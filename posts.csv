0,2025-05-09 07:05:28,Top cybersecurity stories for the week of 05-05-25 to 05-09-25,CISO_Series_Producer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1kijbr2/,"Host Rich Stroffolino will be chatting with our guest, **Dan Holden, CISO, BigCommerce** about some of the biggest stories in cybersecurity this past week. You are invited to watch and participate in the live discussion.   We go to air at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET. Just go to YouTube Live here [https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY](https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY) or you can [subscribe to the Cyber Security Headlines podcast](https://cisoseries.com/subscribe-podcast/) and get it into your feed.  Here are the stories we plan to cover:  **Ransomware attacks on food and agriculture industry have increased this year**   Speaking at RSA, Jonathan Braley, director of the Food and Agriculture-Information Sharing and Analysis Center, (Food and Ag-ISAC), said that paired with the increase in ransomware attacks is the fact that many go unreported, preventing visibility into the full scope of the problem. The increase in attacks seems to stem from activities by the Clop ransomware gang, specifically its exploitation of MOVEit, GoAnywhere and Accellion, as well as activity from the groups RansomHub and Akira. The industry saw 84 attacks from January to March, more than double the number seen in Q1 2024. A report from Food and Ag-ISAC says that industries in food, agriculture, and manufacturing typically face ransomware attacks because they tend to have more legacy equipment and industrial control systems, making them easier targets.   ([The Record](https://therecord.media/ransomware-attacks-food-and-ag-double-2025))  **Congress challenges Noem over proposed CISA cuts**   On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem faced tough questioning from members of Congress about the Trump administration’s proposal to cut CISA’s funding by $491 million, as part of their “skinny budget.” Homeland Security subcommittee chair Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., said at a time when government leaders are saying China is getting the better of the U.S. in cyberspace, appropriators need more information on the budget proposal. Top panel Democrat, Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), said to Noem, “Last week you said we should ‘just wait’ for the president’s grand cyber plan. But you have not waited to erode the department’s cyber defense capabilities by removing resources and personnel from CISA and other components.” Noem maintained that instead of “censorship,” CISA is now focused on securing critical infrastructure. She added that the president’s cyber plan would be “coming out shortly and that’s the president’s prerogative.”   ([CyberScoop](https://cyberscoop.com/house-questions-trump-cisa-budget-cuts-2025/) and[ The Record](https://therecord.media/noem-house-hearing-proposed-cisa-funding-cuts))  **Disney Slack attacker turns out to be Ryan from California**   Following up on a story we covered last July, in which The Walt Disney Company suffered the theft of more than one terabyte of data through its Slack channels, it turns out that the perpetrator was not a Russian hacktivist group, but was instead, 25-year-old California resident Ryan Mitchell Kramer. The hack was originally described as retribution against Disney for how it handled artist contracts, their use of AI, and how it treated its consumers. Now, according to the Department of Justice, “Kramer published a program online that purported to be an AI art generation app but actually contained malware that gave him remote access to the victim’s computer. A Disney employee downloaded the program, allowing Kramer to nab login credentials for various accounts in their name, including their Disney Slack account.” Kramer has agreed to plead guilty to one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information, and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, which could lead to ten years in prison.   ([The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/02/disney_slack_hacker_revealed_to/))  **NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167 million in damages**   On Tuesday, after a five-year legal battle, a jury ruled that NSO Group must pay the Meta-owned platform $167,256,000 in punitive damages and around $444,719 in compensatory damages. WhatsApp accused NSO Group of exploiting an audio-calling vulnerability in the chat app to target around 1,400 people, including dissidents, human rights activists, and journalists. WhatsApp was seeking more than $400,000 in compensatory damages, based on the time its employees spent on investigating and remediating the attacks. A WhatsApp’s spokesperson hailed the historic ruling as, “the first victory against illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone.” NSO Group said it plans to carefully review the details of the verdict and left the door open for an appeal.   ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/nso-group-must-pay-more-than-167-million-in-damages-to-whatsapp-for-spyware-campaign/))  **Telemessage stores plaintext chat logs, suspends services**   TeleMessage, a federal contractor that sold a modified version of Signal called TM SGNL to senior US officials, can reportedly access plaintext chat logs—despite marketing claims suggesting end-to-end encryption. Security researcher Micha Lee analyzed the app’s Android source code and found it insecure, confirming TeleMessage’s access. The company was recently hacked twice, leaking sensitive data and prompting it to suspend operations. Senator Ron Wyden has now called for a DOJ investigation, citing the app as a potential national security threat due to its insecure design and foreign ties.   ([Micha Lee](https://micahflee.com/despite-misleading-marketing-israeli-company-telemessage-used-by-trump-officials-can-access-plaintext-chat-logs/))  **LockBit ransomware gang hacked**   As quoted in BleepingComputer, “the LockBit ransomware gang has suffered a data breach after its dark web affiliate panels were defaced and replaced with a message linking to a MySQL database dump,” which itself appears to have occurred on April 29. It is not known who carried out this breach or how they did it, but the defacement message, which reads, “Don't do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague,"" matches one used in a recent breach of the dark web site belonging to Everest ransomware, suggesting a possible link. BleepingComputer continues “It's too early to tell if this additional reputation hit will be the final nail in the coffin for the ransomware gang.”   ([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-gang-hacked-victim-negotiations-exposed/))  **PowerSchool hacker now extorting individual school districts**   Following up on a story we have been covering since January, the education technology company PowerSchool now says that despite having paid a ransom, “the same threat actor is now attempting to use the stolen data to extort the individual school districts that it works with.” The breach, which occurred in December, exposed sensitive personal data of more than 60 million K-12 students and more than nine million teachers. PowerSchool had expressed confidence that the incident had been resolved, telling Bleeping Computer the hacker shared a video which purported to show the data being deleted. Apparently, this was not the end of the story as at least four school boards have contacted with extortion requests.

1,2025-05-08 06:52:12,School Ransomware attacks,Sunitha_Sundar_5980,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1khqnbw/,"Just read about how the PowerSchool breach led to ransom demands sent directly to families across North America, even after the company paid hackers to delete the stolen data. Turns out the data wasn't wiped after all.  What’s worse? Some of the info goes back decades, student IDs, medical details, emergency contacts. School boards are now scrambling to respond. This really shows how damaging one weak access point (like a compromised admin account) can be.  Do you think schools and edtech platforms are doing enough to secure such sensitive data?

Getting too greedy and nobody will pay,"Schools and higher ed are inadequately supported through funding and resources, so this will continue to be a threat actors ' playground. My team issued a landscape update on this a while back, and the bottom line is that threat actors will test out new techniques on schools because of their poor controls. It lets they do a trial run with minimal resistance before trying it on their primary targets.","The ransom group didn’t delete the data? Man, if you can’t trust criminals to do the thing they promised, who CAN you trust?",They do nothing. Any of the smaller SDs have no security staff. They just have a vice principal who also buys the iPads. Student security needs to be regulated and funded.,"My daughter goes to a school that uses this system and her school division was also ransomwared with data exfil. At 10, she’s already been a victim of two significant breaches.","I'd never realized how bad it was until we looked into it for a report to some of our education customers, but yeah, education software has had a tough go in recent years (Besides PowerSchool). Not to mention the fairly frequent database dumps on places like BreachForums and schools/districts getting named and shamed regularly on ransomware disclosure sites. These were some of the bigger ones that got some notoriety, so roughly 1 per year since 2019:  Raptor Technologies: In January 2024, Raptor Technologies, a school safety software company, experienced a significant data breach. This breach exposed millions of records, including sensitive data and personal information of students, parents, and staff. The breach involved the exposure of over 4 million records. The data included school lockdown plans, student medical records, information on students flagged as posing a threat, evacuation plans, court documents, staff and student ID numbers, and details about school security measures.

CPS used a teacher evaluation vendor named Battelle for Kids, which was the target of a ransomware attack. As a result, nearly 500,000 CPS students and close to 60,000 employees had their personal data exposed. [https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2022/5/20/23132983/cps-public-schools-data-breach-students-employees-records-battelle-kids](https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2022/5/20/23132983/cps-public-schools-data-breach-students-employees-records-battelle-kids)  Pearson AIMweb: In 2019, Pearson AIMSweb was the target of a cyberattack that exposed student data in the AIMSweb student assessment program. The breach affected about 13,000 school and university accounts. ","Smallish to med size school district here in California. We are required per our technology insurance companies to have security tools and protocols in place to prevent any ransomware attack. Some of the smaller schools districts struggle with those costs due to the price to implement these security requirements. There needs to be more money provided to the smaller school districts to protect them from these attacks. But even large districts like this Canadian one can be breached. Even the LA school district got attacked. They never paid a ransom but it took them down for a bit. Powerschool is its own SIS cloud based entity. So either one of the schools accounts that accesses powerschool was compromised or something, the article doesn't get into details on how they where breached.",Better question is do they have the $ to secure data?,"Not to steer away from the focus on schools, but even local and state governments suffer from inadequate cybersecurity and extremely limited resources. It is concerning that schools spend more money on athletics than other areas that need attention. The money is there for a lot of schools, the boards need to prioritize better and be held accountable.","100% they arent doing enough, most companies arent. My bank (top 5 largest in Canada) doesnt even support passkeys yet. Honestly its come to the point imo legislation needs to be enacted to set standards for how protected information is stored(encrypted, geo location etc), how it can be accessed (passwords, passkeys etc), how it can be transmitted (encrypted/plaintext) ... and the big one ... acountability, how do they handle breaches, what actions do they take and what reprocusions are there.   They need real input from security leaders to draft such changes. Right now its a free for all and half the companies are doing nothing. PowerSchool should be an eye opener","No, they’re not. When I look at the platforms where my data was leaked from, the only ones there are for school services we were either forced to use or unknowingly used by them, including PS. It’s clear they don’t have the level of care they need for peoples’ data.","Most that data isn't that sensitive.  Kind of depends what we are talking about with medical data.    I think at some point we lost the plot on data classification. Not to say data shouldn't be secured, but even better not to collect and store it without iron clad relevance and necessity.","Not deleting data? No longer getting payments. Like with everything, your insatiable greed is your end.",Some people are saying we already lose cyber war due to ransomware etc.. People lose to cyber war because some goverments allowing ransomware and they actually support it. If you are safe from ransomware it doesn't mean other peoples are safe. We need to do radical changes from cybersecurity to fix ransomware problem.,"This makes me so angry to think about, but it's just another item on the list of things underfunded in public education in the US. The vast majority of districts need help. Some in my state have banded their IT resources together so they can get volume discounts. It's better, but it's not enough. The free resources provided by MS-ISAC are a boon, but they need more state funding if they are going to stand a modicum of a chance against cybercrime actors with cash to burn.",">even after the company paid hackers to delete the stolen data. Turns out the data wasn't wiped after all.  This kind a behavior damages the reputation of ALL ransomware groups, and will likely lead to the group that perpetrated this attack to be attacked or turned in by other groups, funnily enough.  Ransomware groups have a pretty strong code that is there to benefit all of them. If a bunch of groups pop up that simply take the ransom and don't unlock, or don't delete the data, etc. people will simply stop paying the ransoms.",I think it's time we form a group will call our selfs the C team short for cyber team kinda like the A team but with a C so will have cyber security specialist work with triangulation people kick them off other people's networks smoke cigars triangulate them and make money  I mean why be a cyber worrier when you can be a blackhat killa,Ransom-wares are becoming less common now anyway. It’s simply not efficient enough for companies to be doing so.,"I mean, totally seriously, that this is going to impact the market reputation of other ransomware actors. Some have worked hard to establish that their ransom demands will be respected.","What are the odds they even give your data back if they did fully secure it. They usually don't, and that's why the FBI says do not pay.","I read from somewhere it says ransomware gangs really giving your data back if you pay it but that doesn't always happens and sometimes they ask more. Even if you are didn't pay if you contact with them you are motivating them. Ransomware gangs goal is not only earn money, they want delete your data forever by attacking you. Data recovery companies wants to get more money from ransomware gangs requested which makes people to think should I pay to ransom?","I’m really sorry to hear that. It’s alarming; this needs to be a wake-up call for schools and edtech providers, the cost of getting it wrong affects real families in very real ways.",It’s an older breach. Here’s more https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/powerschool-previously-hacked-in-august-months-before-data-breach/,"A lot of schools don’t have the budget or expertise to implement enterprise-level security, but that doesn’t make the risk any less real. It’s why partnerships with secure platforms, better oversight, and even government support for cybersecurity in education are becoming critical. Because at the end of the day, lack of funding can’t be an excuse for putting student data at risk.","We need frameworks that aren’t just checkboxes but enforceable, transparent, and built for today’s threat landscape.","Greed, whether from attackers or negligence in security ultimately hurts the people who trusted these systems the most.","Wild, isn’t it? Even in the world of cybercrime, “reputation” matters.   When one group breaks the so-called ransomware code by not deleting data after payment it shakes trust across the entire underground economy.  This kind of betrayal doesn’t just damage victims. It disrupts the criminals’ business model too. Because once trust is gone, so is the ransom revenue.  Hard to believe we’re talking about **trust** among hackers but that’s how fragile and bizarre the ecosystem really is.",[removed],"On a personal level, sure. For these big jobs, they are normally perpetrated by well-known groups. They have a reputation to uphold, otherwise companies will simply opt to not pay and work on data recovery themselves.",And some ransomware gangs says data recovery companies contact with us to recover data.,I remember now. It was an internal breach that was caught by an outsider,"They already hold a reputation for not being trusted.   They're why it's always said, never pay the ransom.

This is my worst nightmare.  And then finding out that the ransomware was paid, and deletion was validated via a video... would probably have me experiencing night terrors for the remainder of my life.    Hell our cyber security insurance would have a field day dropping us over that one. ","Sorry kids, your data was gone before you could learn to protect yourself.","It's a good thing they watched the criminals delete the data via video conference once they paid the ransom. I'm sure the criminals didn't lie and make a copy, so all good.",My wife showed me a post of a local school stating that they were affected by the breach but “no private student data was stolen”. I told her that whoever made the post was an idiot for concretely stating that before the whole scope of the incident was revealed.,"chat this isn't ransomware because they never lost access to the data, someone just copied it.   This is plain, good old fashioned extortion.   with that said, I doubt they actually deleted the files. when I heard of the initial attack and that the ""data was deleted"" I was suspicious right away. even two friendly parties can just barely attest to things through mutual trust.   at best I suspect the stolen data to be released at a later time rather than immediately so the perps can pretend to be upstanding guys to other victims.","Taken via a Ukrainian VPS IP. Not even the most basic geo IP restrictions or even notifications for 3rd party support contractor log ins. Also no second Auth factor, also all tier 1 support contractors had full access to all of this data for every customer. Absolutely insane.   PowerSchool didn't even know this happened until the threat actor reached out to them 6 days later asking for money.  Changing SIS is a very expensive and change management-heavy lift, but I'll be pushing the districts I work with to move off of it if at all possible. I shudder to think what other practices aren't in place.",Yeah our students school tried to downplay this. Clearly this is much bigger than originally thought. Insane.,"If you pay a hacker to delete stolen data, I think you have met the definition of “ransomware attack”. I’m sure their lawyers and insurance carrier would disagree.   It’s also a complete violation of any trust or reputation they may have had with their clients. I’m sure this path of minimal disclosure and carefully worded press releases helps minimize their legal liability, but what a terrible way to help the people most impacted - the students and teachers whose data was stolen.","Powerschool is getting off so easy for this.  In PA, the SCHOOL is required to notify affected users. And Act 151 of 2022 requires the notifying agency to also pay for credit monitoring. One district was quoted $190k for ~1,700 users... which means taxpayers are footing that bill.  I guess schools could do an insurance claim or possibly subrogate against PS, but, man. It's a mess.",one day we will live in a world where personal data has an expiration date so this shit wont happen,My kids' school stores the student Google username and password in there too.

In my old life I worked as an analyst in post-secondary education. Because post-secondary learned some hard lessons, it grew to have best in class cybersecurity requirements. I'm absolutely shocked that same-as standards are not in place for individuals who are not even adults. It seems Primary and Secondary education seem to be playing fast and loose with data. Kinda problematic when migrating legacy data into an insecure system when those individuals haven't authorized this data-use.

The entire student and teacher tables were dumped.  If you had no PII/PHI stored in those tables, it's a fair assumption.  Powerschool has also been very cryptic about this entire process.

Frankly, I don't even see why they NEED to put the SSN on some fuck-off online server. All they SHOULD do is verify it once in-person during enrollment. Not store it on the Cloud where, the first thing you learn in ANY Cybersecurity lecture is that, no matter how ""secure"" something is, there is a way to breach it and hackers will find a way.  This is what happens when you let uneducated boomers control how data is stored. They get distracted when ""Steve Gates from Microsoft"" tells them there's a virus on their computer and the only way to get rid of it is to give them the password and 2FA code (assuming they even have 2FA set up) and NOW all the students who have ever enrolled in our school's social security numbers are leaked online for any idiot who wants to take out a loan in someone else's name to do! Oopsie daisies! Better luck next time, I guess!","It's likely not the school. Powerschool has been so unsupportive during this process it's unreal.  K-12 also faces a tech talent problem. It's likely that the school didn't intentionally mislead or downplay this, but was relying on what Powerschool did (or did not) tell them.",">I’m sure this path of minimal disclosure and carefully worded press releases helps minimize their legal liability   I don't believe that is necessarily the reason to assume. When looking at serious successfull cyber attacks a point I'd like to see more emphasis on is that the defenders will be in utter chaos. People break in such conditions from having decades of work invalidated, from extreme workload, and from extreme pressure from everywhere else. A good rule of thumb is that from the team originally responsible for the attacked service half will be unfit for work overnight. Especially the team lead and often permanently. This is the type of stress that can literally kill people.   In that situation you will have among others to onboard internal replacements for the lost colleagues, external specialists, likely a new team structure, and often completely throw any and all established procedures (as assumed unsafe) overboard, completely relearning how to do your job.   The thing that breaks first here is internal communications. People doing their utmost to save what's left on a technical side have neither the time nor mental capacity to sit down and write cohesive reports. They don't have an established leadership structure ensuring that to happen. And even if they have, these situations are so fluidly moving in parallel that it's impossible to stay up to date. You'll produce more meeting notes per hour than can be read in the same.   As such those in the company not directly involved - especially the higher ups which do get a lot of related work and stresses -  will not have a good idea of what's going on.    TlDr: very long winded way of saying that sparse public comment is majorly caused by companies themselves not knowing what's happening and given a large enough issue cannot reasonably be expected to know either. Liability is definitely an issue, but it's not the only reason for this to happen.",">If you pay a hacker to delete stolen data, I think you have met the definition of “ransomware attack”.  Not trying to be argumentative, but I don't agree. ""Ransomware"" has a specific meaning along the lines of ""software that forces a ransom in order to be deactivated"".  There was no software. Someone just dumped all of their data, and then blackmailed them into paying a ransom.","Apparently FERPA is only used to punish and control the little guys.  The ones not big enough to pay lobbyists, bribes, and ransoms.",I wouldn’t hold my breath,"Compromised credential (seemingly not behind MFA) used Powerschool's ""phone home"" support channel to tunnel into affected districts.","100% this.

It’s the insurer’s money going to the hackers at that point.,"your tag says CISO, yet you are saying never pay? What happens when a company doesn't have backups, or the backups are somehow also popped, does security not exist to enable the business? I'd love to not need to pay a ransom but we all know too many business do not follow best practices",The extra crunchy ones!,"Yea, I feel like if you look at doe job boards you can see that they might not have the best filling senior cyber roles. I mean I could bag that role but I shouldn’t lol","This. It was a PowerSchool support account itself that was compromised, you can see what they did in the logs, and it wasn't sophisticated. They had access and the opportunity, and they took it. Many districts wouldn't keep PII in the students or teachers tables, unfortunately it appears that quite a few did however.",Cool I can also make a copy of stolen data and then make a video of me deleting it.,"It’s odd, but I don’t believe people realize that threat actors must establish a reputation too. If they are known to not actually delete, nobody will pay in the future. We see this a good bit around ransomware actors who wouldn’t provide a key after payment.",There are hacker groups that have reputations to uphold.  It's possible that they have good reason to think the hackers did delete the data. But I haven't heard that reason yet.,"Yes, they didn’t use an incapacitating software agent. But holding stolen data hostage for a ransom never gets called Data Kidnapping.","No MFA!? Oh no……that sucks, such an easy thing to implement…. Sometimes our plates our too full I guess.","If you can't secure your shit for Gen 1, good fucking luck with Gen 2. Especially since you just funded it.  People have zero fucks to give about moral hazards anymore, do they?",Ransom funds terrorism.,Or you work at a hospital and now lives are at risk.,The only people that say “never pay” have never been involved in an incident.,"Yeh, the ""CISO"" lives in la la land.","In PA, teachers were tracked by SSN prior to the PPID (started in 2006, became mandatory in 2011), so if data is older than that and wasn't purged, it for sure has it.",They used the Shred command though! /s,"Believe it or not, these hackers have a reputation to care about.        If they release the data anyways, why would their next victim pay???        They have zero reason to release the data. Many reasons to NOT release it. Assuming they kept it.",From what I understand - the support credentials were obtained from the dark web. So - how many other people accessed this info? Or worse - more info. I’m terrified to hear the discoveries in the upcoming report. Hopefully their logs will show more than 2 weeks!,MFA is the most basic shit regardless of how full your plate is lmao. This is gross negligence,I don’t quite understand your last sentence. Where does morality come into play here?,I don’t quite understand your last sentence. Where does morality come into play here?,"So does the US government, and on a far grander scale. If ransoms are funding terrorism then combatting cyber crime should be a higher priority for our governments.","Makes sense when its a group owning the attack.    This, afaik this is just some random extortion. If thats the case there's absolutely reason to release it, double dip since they paid once.. or sell on auction","Totally agree. There's no way to frame this as ""aw shucks"" when you're dealing with millions of children's PII and something so simple to implement.",you're playing the game and making it a viable money making industry. i hope you don't work in this field...,"Hes implying ur funding malware that will be further distributed i guess, as well as terrorism etc","Moral hazard refers to giving someone something they did t work for, or saving them from the consequences of their negligence.   Most famously during the ‘08 crisis they decided against individual payouts using the Moral Hazard it may create as a reason.   Nevermind the moral hazard of banks gambling…",surely talking about this in the cybersecurity reddit echo chamber will be a productive conversation,"""yeah but what about""","First time here reading/posting here. Some people are very idealistic, I suppose. That goes out the window when it’s 3AM on Christmas morning and you get an alert from your MDR.","Ransom money funding terrorism is a very broad, amorphous claim. There are thousands of groups out there exfiltrating and extorting data. Companies carry cyber threat insurance for a reason.",Heres hoping one day i can even have the opportunity to experience that misfortune,"At the very least, that means funding cybercrime. But often indeed it is backed by either mafias or totalitarian states."
4,2025-01-08 20:07:36,PowerSchool confirms it was subject to a cyber attack that resulted in the theft of sensitive student and teacher information.,Novel_Negotiation224,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hx347i/,,"What do you bet - No MFA on the stolen creds. Plus the design of their app allowed these creds to export everything to a CSV without a second ""sign off"".  Very poor app design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2025-01-07 19:45:08,So PowerSchool had a breach....,Hazy_Arc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hw9gu0/,,PowerSchool is one of the leading Student Information Systems in use across the US and Canada. It appears compromised support credentials were used to dump student and teacher data from hosted AND on-prem instances. This will likely affect hundreds of thousands of people.,"My kid’s school was affected. Kid’s names, birthdates, addresses and phone numbers.  But “PowerSchool senior leadership is confident that the data was not released publicly and has been deleted”. So I feel relieved. /s","The organizations have yet to recognize that securing digital assets and information is paramount, even in 2025.  Strict regulations alone won't prevent breaches; actual security practices must be embraced wholeheartedly to protect against threats effectively.","If you or someone you know was impacted by the PowerSchool Breach, please sign this OpenLetter https://openletter.earth/collection-of-childrens-data-powerschool-breach-07fb8218","The legal requirements for school districts and by extension, their 3rd party providers, is grossly lacking. Many states don’t even suggest MFA yet.",That all sounds great - but are you willing to have increased taxes to fund a cybersecurity expert for each school district? Herein lies the issue - school districts have trouble keeping the lights on - do you really think they have the funds to adequately fund a cybersecurity expert on staff?    Never mind the fact that this issue wasn’t even the result of inadequacy from school districts; rather it was a fuck up from a multi million dollar company.,I'm actively working on legislation here in Texas to address these kinds of issues. If this is your letter. Please contact me.,"School districts are accountable for this. They can’t wipe their hands of that just because they outsourced it. Maybe they don’t need a cyber expert on staff but they absolutely need to find a way to validate all the security claims their partners are making.   I know we don’t know what happened with PowerSchool exactly but we can all see the red flags in their controls - seemingly no MFA, always on backdoor support channel to all environments, apparently inadequate access control and terrible detection capabilities…   We’re doing our profession a disservice making excuses for school districts just because they weren’t* the data processors here.   NIST added supply chain management to the CSF for a reason.","I agree that schools don’t get nearly the support they need. And yet some schools spend as much as 6 million a year just for bussing. Do you honestly think abstaining from supporting such an initiative will mean taxes remain stagnant? At least ensure taxes are put to a worthy cause rather than just lining someone else’s pockets. Regardless, even if only half the list was enforced it’d still offer better protection than what kids get now; which is absolutely nothing. If funding a knowledgeable expert was the only concern, I’d still sign.",Would love to hear more about it! DM me!,Validating security claims requires security expertise. Ideally there would be some sort of FOSS system that they could spin up in a simple cloud instance or something. 🤷‍♀️It’s a tough spot.,"Hello.
