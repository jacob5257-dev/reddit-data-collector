0,2025-05-09 07:05:28,Top cybersecurity stories for the week of 05-05-25 to 05-09-25,CISO_Series_Producer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1kijbr2/,"Host Rich Stroffolino will be chatting with our guest, **Dan Holden, CISO, BigCommerce** about some of the biggest stories in cybersecurity this past week. You are invited to watch and participate in the live discussion.   We go to air at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET. Just go to YouTube Live here [https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY](https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY) or you can [subscribe to the Cyber Security Headlines podcast](https://cisoseries.com/subscribe-podcast/) and get it into your feed.  Here are the stories we plan to cover:  **Ransomware attacks on food and agriculture industry have increased this year**   Speaking at RSA, Jonathan Braley, director of the Food and Agriculture-Information Sharing and Analysis Center, (Food and Ag-ISAC), said that paired with the increase in ransomware attacks is the fact that many go unreported, preventing visibility into the full scope of the problem. The increase in attacks seems to stem from activities by the Clop ransomware gang, specifically its exploitation of MOVEit, GoAnywhere and Accellion, as well as activity from the groups RansomHub and Akira. The industry saw 84 attacks from January to March, more than double the number seen in Q1 2024. A report from Food and Ag-ISAC says that industries in food, agriculture, and manufacturing typically face ransomware attacks because they tend to have more legacy equipment and industrial control systems, making them easier targets.   ([The Record](https://therecord.media/ransomware-attacks-food-and-ag-double-2025))  **Congress challenges Noem over proposed CISA cuts**   On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem faced tough questioning from members of Congress about the Trump administration’s proposal to cut CISA’s funding by $491 million, as part of their “skinny budget.” Homeland Security subcommittee chair Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., said at a time when government leaders are saying China is getting the better of the U.S. in cyberspace, appropriators need more information on the budget proposal. Top panel Democrat, Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), said to Noem, “Last week you said we should ‘just wait’ for the president’s grand cyber plan. But you have not waited to erode the department’s cyber defense capabilities by removing resources and personnel from CISA and other components.” Noem maintained that instead of “censorship,” CISA is now focused on securing critical infrastructure. She added that the president’s cyber plan would be “coming out shortly and that’s the president’s prerogative.”   ([CyberScoop](https://cyberscoop.com/house-questions-trump-cisa-budget-cuts-2025/) and[ The Record](https://therecord.media/noem-house-hearing-proposed-cisa-funding-cuts))  **Disney Slack attacker turns out to be Ryan from California**   Following up on a story we covered last July, in which The Walt Disney Company suffered the theft of more than one terabyte of data through its Slack channels, it turns out that the perpetrator was not a Russian hacktivist group, but was instead, 25-year-old California resident Ryan Mitchell Kramer. The hack was originally described as retribution against Disney for how it handled artist contracts, their use of AI, and how it treated its consumers. Now, according to the Department of Justice, “Kramer published a program online that purported to be an AI art generation app but actually contained malware that gave him remote access to the victim’s computer. A Disney employee downloaded the program, allowing Kramer to nab login credentials for various accounts in their name, including their Disney Slack account.” Kramer has agreed to plead guilty to one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information, and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, which could lead to ten years in prison.   ([The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/02/disney_slack_hacker_revealed_to/))  **NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167 million in damages**   On Tuesday, after a five-year legal battle, a jury ruled that NSO Group must pay the Meta-owned platform $167,256,000 in punitive damages and around $444,719 in compensatory damages. WhatsApp accused NSO Group of exploiting an audio-calling vulnerability in the chat app to target around 1,400 people, including dissidents, human rights activists, and journalists. WhatsApp was seeking more than $400,000 in compensatory damages, based on the time its employees spent on investigating and remediating the attacks. A WhatsApp’s spokesperson hailed the historic ruling as, “the first victory against illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone.” NSO Group said it plans to carefully review the details of the verdict and left the door open for an appeal.   ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/nso-group-must-pay-more-than-167-million-in-damages-to-whatsapp-for-spyware-campaign/))  **Telemessage stores plaintext chat logs, suspends services**   TeleMessage, a federal contractor that sold a modified version of Signal called TM SGNL to senior US officials, can reportedly access plaintext chat logs—despite marketing claims suggesting end-to-end encryption. Security researcher Micha Lee analyzed the app’s Android source code and found it insecure, confirming TeleMessage’s access. The company was recently hacked twice, leaking sensitive data and prompting it to suspend operations. Senator Ron Wyden has now called for a DOJ investigation, citing the app as a potential national security threat due to its insecure design and foreign ties.   ([Micha Lee](https://micahflee.com/despite-misleading-marketing-israeli-company-telemessage-used-by-trump-officials-can-access-plaintext-chat-logs/))  **LockBit ransomware gang hacked**   As quoted in BleepingComputer, “the LockBit ransomware gang has suffered a data breach after its dark web affiliate panels were defaced and replaced with a message linking to a MySQL database dump,” which itself appears to have occurred on April 29. It is not known who carried out this breach or how they did it, but the defacement message, which reads, “Don't do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague,"" matches one used in a recent breach of the dark web site belonging to Everest ransomware, suggesting a possible link. BleepingComputer continues “It's too early to tell if this additional reputation hit will be the final nail in the coffin for the ransomware gang.”   ([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-gang-hacked-victim-negotiations-exposed/))  **PowerSchool hacker now extorting individual school districts**   Following up on a story we have been covering since January, the education technology company PowerSchool now says that despite having paid a ransom, “the same threat actor is now attempting to use the stolen data to extort the individual school districts that it works with.” The breach, which occurred in December, exposed sensitive personal data of more than 60 million K-12 students and more than nine million teachers. PowerSchool had expressed confidence that the incident had been resolved, telling Bleeping Computer the hacker shared a video which purported to show the data being deleted. Apparently, this was not the end of the story as at least four school boards have contacted with extortion requests.

1,2025-05-08 06:52:12,School Ransomware attacks,Sunitha_Sundar_5980,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1khqnbw/,"Just read about how the PowerSchool breach led to ransom demands sent directly to families across North America, even after the company paid hackers to delete the stolen data. Turns out the data wasn't wiped after all.  What’s worse? Some of the info goes back decades, student IDs, medical details, emergency contacts. School boards are now scrambling to respond. This really shows how damaging one weak access point (like a compromised admin account) can be.  Do you think schools and edtech platforms are doing enough to secure such sensitive data?  Source: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/powerschool-ransom-extortion-demands-1.7529277](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/powerschool-ransom-extortion-demands-1.7529277)",Even more reason to NOT pay the ransom. Getting too greedy and nobody will pay,"Schools and higher ed are inadequately supported through funding and resources, so this will continue to be a threat actors ' playground. My team issued a landscape update on this a while back, and the bottom line is that threat actors will test out new techniques on schools because of their poor controls. It lets they do a trial run with minimal resistance before trying it on their primary targets.","The ransom group didn’t delete the data? Man, if you can’t trust criminals to do the thing they promised, who CAN you trust?",They do nothing. Any of the smaller SDs have no security staff. They just have a vice principal who also buys the iPads. Student security needs to be regulated and funded.,"My daughter goes to a school that uses this system and her school division was also ransomwared with data exfil. At 10, she’s already been a victim of two significant breaches.","I'd never realized how bad it was until we looked into it for a report to some of our education customers, but yeah, education software has had a tough go in recent years (Besides PowerSchool). Not to mention the fairly frequent database dumps on places like BreachForums and schools/districts getting named and shamed regularly on ransomware disclosure sites. These were some of the bigger ones that got some notoriety, so roughly 1 per year since 2019:  Raptor Technologies: In January 2024, Raptor Technologies, a school safety software company, experienced a significant data breach. This breach exposed millions of records, including sensitive data and personal information of students, parents, and staff. The breach involved the exposure of over 4 million records. The data included school lockdown plans, student medical records, information on students flagged as posing a threat, evacuation plans, court documents, staff and student ID numbers, and details about school security measures.

CPS used a teacher evaluation vendor named Battelle for Kids, which was the target of a ransomware attack. As a result, nearly 500,000 CPS students and close to 60,000 employees had their personal data exposed. [https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2022/5/20/23132983/cps-public-schools-data-breach-students-employees-records-battelle-kids](https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2022/5/20/23132983/cps-public-schools-data-breach-students-employees-records-battelle-kids)  Pearson AIMweb: In 2019, Pearson AIMSweb was the target of a cyberattack that exposed student data in the AIMSweb student assessment program. The breach affected about 13,000 school and university accounts. ","Smallish to med size school district here in California. We are required per our technology insurance companies to have security tools and protocols in place to prevent any ransomware attack. Some of the smaller schools districts struggle with those costs due to the price to implement these security requirements. There needs to be more money provided to the smaller school districts to protect them from these attacks. But even large districts like this Canadian one can be breached. Even the LA school district got attacked. They never paid a ransom but it took them down for a bit. Powerschool is its own SIS cloud based entity. So either one of the schools accounts that accesses powerschool was compromised or something, the article doesn't get into details on how they where breached.",Better question is do they have the $ to secure data?,"Not to steer away from the focus on schools, but even local and state governments suffer from inadequate cybersecurity and extremely limited resources. It is concerning that schools spend more money on athletics than other areas that need attention. The money is there for a lot of schools, the boards need to prioritize better and be held accountable.","100% they arent doing enough, most companies arent. My bank (top 5 largest in Canada) doesnt even support passkeys yet. Honestly its come to the point imo legislation needs to be enacted to set standards for how protected information is stored(encrypted, geo location etc), how it can be accessed (passwords, passkeys etc), how it can be transmitted (encrypted/plaintext) ... and the big one ... acountability, how do they handle breaches, what actions do they take and what reprocusions are there.   They need real input from security leaders to draft such changes. Right now its a free for all and half the companies are doing nothing. PowerSchool should be an eye opener","No, they’re not. When I look at the platforms where my data was leaked from, the only ones there are for school services we were either forced to use or unknowingly used by them, including PS. It’s clear they don’t have the level of care they need for peoples’ data.","Most that data isn't that sensitive.  Kind of depends what we are talking about with medical data.    I think at some point we lost the plot on data classification. Not to say data shouldn't be secured, but even better not to collect and store it without iron clad relevance and necessity.","Not deleting data? No longer getting payments. Like with everything, your insatiable greed is your end.",Some people are saying we already lose cyber war due to ransomware etc.. People lose to cyber war because some goverments allowing ransomware and they actually support it. If you are safe from ransomware it doesn't mean other peoples are safe. We need to do radical changes from cybersecurity to fix ransomware problem.,"This makes me so angry to think about, but it's just another item on the list of things underfunded in public education in the US. The vast majority of districts need help. Some in my state have banded their IT resources together so they can get volume discounts. It's better, but it's not enough. The free resources provided by MS-ISAC are a boon, but they need more state funding if they are going to stand a modicum of a chance against cybercrime actors with cash to burn.",">even after the company paid hackers to delete the stolen data. Turns out the data wasn't wiped after all.  This kind a behavior damages the reputation of ALL ransomware groups, and will likely lead to the group that perpetrated this attack to be attacked or turned in by other groups, funnily enough.  Ransomware groups have a pretty strong code that is there to benefit all of them. If a bunch of groups pop up that simply take the ransom and don't unlock, or don't delete the data, etc. people will simply stop paying the ransoms.",I think it's time we form a group will call our selfs the C team short for cyber team kinda like the A team but with a C so will have cyber security specialist work with triangulation people kick them off other people's networks smoke cigars triangulate them and make money  I mean why be a cyber worrier when you can be a blackhat killa,Ransom-wares are becoming less common now anyway. It’s simply not efficient enough for companies to be doing so.,"I mean, totally seriously, that this is going to impact the market reputation of other ransomware actors. Some have worked hard to establish that their ransom demands will be respected.","What are the odds they even give your data back if they did fully secure it. They usually don't, and that's why the FBI says do not pay.","I read from somewhere it says ransomware gangs really giving your data back if you pay it but that doesn't always happens and sometimes they ask more. Even if you are didn't pay if you contact with them you are motivating them. Ransomware gangs goal is not only earn money, they want delete your data forever by attacking you. Data recovery companies wants to get more money from ransomware gangs requested which makes people to think should I pay to ransom?","I’m really sorry to hear that. It’s alarming; this needs to be a wake-up call for schools and edtech providers, the cost of getting it wrong affects real families in very real ways.",It’s an older breach. Here’s more https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/powerschool-previously-hacked-in-august-months-before-data-breach/,"A lot of schools don’t have the budget or expertise to implement enterprise-level security, but that doesn’t make the risk any less real. It’s why partnerships with secure platforms, better oversight, and even government support for cybersecurity in education are becoming critical. Because at the end of the day, lack of funding can’t be an excuse for putting student data at risk.","We need frameworks that aren’t just checkboxes but enforceable, transparent, and built for today’s threat landscape.","Greed, whether from attackers or negligence in security ultimately hurts the people who trusted these systems the most.","Wild, isn’t it? Even in the world of cybercrime, “reputation” matters.   When one group breaks the so-called ransomware code by not deleting data after payment it shakes trust across the entire underground economy.  This kind of betrayal doesn’t just damage victims. It disrupts the criminals’ business model too. Because once trust is gone, so is the ransom revenue.  Hard to believe we’re talking about **trust** among hackers but that’s how fragile and bizarre the ecosystem really is.",[removed],"On a personal level, sure. For these big jobs, they are normally perpetrated by well-known groups. They have a reputation to uphold, otherwise companies will simply opt to not pay and work on data recovery themselves.",And some ransomware gangs says data recovery companies contact with us to recover data.,I remember now. It was an internal breach that was caught by an outsider,"They already hold a reputation for not being trusted.   They're why it's always said, never pay the ransom. You don't negotiate with terrorists.",You should make your own post and not hijack someone else's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is my worst nightmare.  And then finding out that the ransomware was paid, and deletion was validated via a video... would probably have me experiencing night terrors for the remainder of my life.    Hell our cyber security insurance would have a field day dropping us over that one. ","Sorry kids, your data was gone before you could learn to protect yourself.","It's a good thing they watched the criminals delete the data via video conference once they paid the ransom. I'm sure the criminals didn't lie and make a copy, so all good.",My wife showed me a post of a local school stating that they were affected by the breach but “no private student data was stolen”. I told her that whoever made the post was an idiot for concretely stating that before the whole scope of the incident was revealed.,"chat this isn't ransomware because they never lost access to the data, someone just copied it.   This is plain, good old fashioned extortion.   with that said, I doubt they actually deleted the files. when I heard of the initial attack and that the ""data was deleted"" I was suspicious right away. even two friendly parties can just barely attest to things through mutual trust.   at best I suspect the stolen data to be released at a later time rather than immediately so the perps can pretend to be upstanding guys to other victims.","Taken via a Ukrainian VPS IP. Not even the most basic geo IP restrictions or even notifications for 3rd party support contractor log ins. Also no second Auth factor, also all tier 1 support contractors had full access to all of this data for every customer. Absolutely insane.   PowerSchool didn't even know this happened until the threat actor reached out to them 6 days later asking for money.  Changing SIS is a very expensive and change management-heavy lift, but I'll be pushing the districts I work with to move off of it if at all possible. I shudder to think what other practices aren't in place.",Yeah our students school tried to downplay this. Clearly this is much bigger than originally thought. Insane.,"If you pay a hacker to delete stolen data, I think you have met the definition of “ransomware attack”. I’m sure their lawyers and insurance carrier would disagree.   It’s also a complete violation of any trust or reputation they may have had with their clients. I’m sure this path of minimal disclosure and carefully worded press releases helps minimize their legal liability, but what a terrible way to help the people most impacted - the students and teachers whose data was stolen.","Powerschool is getting off so easy for this.  In PA, the SCHOOL is required to notify affected users. And Act 151 of 2022 requires the notifying agency to also pay for credit monitoring. One district was quoted $190k for ~1,700 users... which means taxpayers are footing that bill.  I guess schools could do an insurance claim or possibly subrogate against PS, but, man.

We have found everything was accessed including PII data - 1 week later  Followed with ""we take your privacy and security seriously and work hard to protect our customers""  line...","What’s frustrating is the school division I went to school for in the 90s into the late 2000s won’t tell me if my data was in powerschool or what kind of data was stored.   It’s frustrating cause it sounds like the system can be used in many ways, if it was just stuff like my name and address and grades from 15-25 years ago i don’t care, but if they have stuff like my parents names, my full legal name, list of schools just think of all the services that use that as recovery questions.","I came across this as an elementary parent and elementary teacher in a district that uses powerschool.

In my old life I worked as an analyst in post-secondary education. Because post-secondary learned some hard lessons, it grew to have best in class cybersecurity requirements. I'm absolutely shocked that same-as standards are not in place for individuals who are not even adults. It seems Primary and Secondary education seem to be playing fast and loose with data. Kinda problematic when migrating legacy data into an insecure system when those individuals haven't authorized this data-use.

The entire student and teacher tables were dumped.  If you had no PII/PHI stored in those tables, it's a fair assumption.  Powerschool has also been very cryptic about this entire process.

Just lie and assume the people are too stupid to do their own research. They KNEW they were purchasing poorly-secured software to store everybody's most personal data.   Frankly, I don't even see why they NEED to put the SSN on some fuck-off online server. All they SHOULD do is verify it once in-person during enrollment. Not store it on the Cloud where, the first thing you learn in ANY Cybersecurity lecture is that, no matter how ""secure"" something is, there is a way to breach it and hackers will find a way.  This is what happens when you let uneducated boomers control how data is stored. They get distracted when ""Steve Gates from Microsoft"" tells them there's a virus on their computer and the only way to get rid of it is to give them the password and 2FA code (assuming they even have 2FA set up) and NOW all the students who have ever enrolled in our school's social security numbers are leaked online for any idiot who wants to take out a loan in someone else's name to do! Oopsie daisies! Better luck next time, I guess!","It's likely not the school. Powerschool has been so unsupportive during this process it's unreal.  K-12 also faces a tech talent problem. It's likely that the school didn't intentionally mislead or downplay this, but was relying on what Powerschool did (or did not) tell them.",">I’m sure this path of minimal disclosure and carefully worded press releases helps minimize their legal liability   I don't believe that is necessarily the reason to assume. When looking at serious successfull cyber attacks a point I'd like to see more emphasis on is that the defenders will be in utter chaos. People break in such conditions from having decades of work invalidated, from extreme workload, and from extreme pressure from everywhere else. A good rule of thumb is that from the team originally responsible for the attacked service half will be unfit for work overnight. Especially the team lead and often permanently. This is the type of stress that can literally kill people.   In that situation you will have among others to onboard internal replacements for the lost colleagues, external specialists, likely a new team structure, and often completely throw any and all established procedures (as assumed unsafe) overboard, completely relearning how to do your job.   The thing that breaks first here is internal communications. People doing their utmost to save what's left on a technical side have neither the time nor mental capacity to sit down and write cohesive reports.

Yes, probably someone will pay, but of all the targets for this sort of thing, school districts seem like the worst.","It's gutting to see this unfold, especially since it wasn't just one school district but so many across North America. The real problem is how the breach started with a compromised admin account used for remote support, which is a classic weak link. If a single privileged credential gets popped, attackers can pivot through everything that account touches. Even after a ransom payment, there's never a guarantee data will actually be deleted, and now we're seeing the fallout as families face repeat extortion.

How hard could it be to move away from SSN for credit and add some simple security?,"It feels like a fake benefit to me. This is something that should be covered by the feds. You figure they wouldn't want SSN abuse. It's definitely covered by a lot of top banks and credit card. It's also being used as a way to avoid legit punishment.   It's equivalent to causing a customer damage, but offering early detection for additional damages. It does nothing to atone for the original mistake.","Yeah, not much value to student numbers outside of the school system.   Having SSN compromised would be a much bigger deal. That said I still consider this an egregious breach.","You don't have to provide a SSN in the USA, the forms have a SSN box but we never did and we were never asked.","Correct. I started out working in a school and built stuff from the ground up working from teacher and student experience. It would great, people loved it  But school funders don't want to fund tech and tech funders don't want to fund school. It takes a year or two to get a school onboard and migrate them. The step function on the revenue is brutal. Silicon Valley funders don't care if schools are stable long-term revenue, they want line to go up fast so they can exit   I'd keep working on it forever for peanuts if I could have, but I couldn't keep up with school needs on my own and couldn't ramp up revenue fast enough to actually hire people after initial grants ran out :-(  It's all quite depressing, and PowerSchool marches on.","Oh yeah.

Historically, before a encrypting the target's data, the exfil as much of it as possible. Since companies back everything up, they will sometimes not pay for the unlock. Groups then started saying, ""okay, pay up or we'll release all of the data"". Companies pay, get unlocked, and the group deletes that data. There is a lot of trust there, but actually deleting the data is in the best interest of the group. If you say are you going to delete it, then it comes out anyway, no company is ever going to pay you again. Believe it or not, these groups actually have paid customer support and their service is actually better than most legit companies. While being completely shit people, at least they know their reputation is the only thing that keeps companies, and their IT insurance companies, paying.","Because that's the only thing that gets the hackers paid. If the hackers didn't hold up their end of the bargain then nobody will pay, ever. In other words, the hackers value their word a lot more than one would think. This is why the criticism of companies paying these groups falls flat because it's mutually beneficial to maintain that trust, company keeps their secrets and the group gets rich.","Thanks for that...

15,2025-05-21 12:05:26,Staff Titles?,luvvie90,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1ks65yo/,"Hey all, We're switching SIS's (from PowerSchool to Infinite Campus) and I'm using this opportunity to clean up. We currently have 148 different titles for staff, and only about 200 staff members.   My question specifically is at the middle and high school levels. Do y'all set the teachers' title as their grade level, their subject, or both? i.e. 6th Grade Teacher, Social Studies Teacher, or 6th Grade Social Studies Teacher  And in your SIS, how do you have your coaches? Are they all just Coach or do you have Assistant Coaches? Do you include the sport?   Thank you!  ","Keep it simple. Building>Teacher/Aide/admin, etc. No need for more than that. This makes things infinitely easier when setting permissions and resource access.","Titles in my SIS are as generic as I can make them.   If HR wants specific duties of an individual, they can look in their own software or refer to building administration.    Teachers often change subjects and grade levels taught. I'd consider it a poor use of my time to try and maintain those district wide. Plus, it's really nice to be able to search 'title = Teacher' and pull a list of everyone.  If we had coaches in our SIS, I would title them 'Coach'.","I second what everyone else is saying. For the most part, our systems mirror what HR has. Any changes come through job change requests, and are processed when received. SIS is handled by a different team, but they get notified through the same workflow, so everything tends to stay consistent","I am an Infinite Campus System Admin.  If you plan to automate permissions within Campus I would suggest breaking them up with titles that match permission groups.  For example we use building short name (calendar)- permission group:  HS-Teacher, MS-Secretary, ES-FoodService, etc.  I wouldn't overcomplicate it beyond that.  Scheduling uses departments tied to courses so titles don't matter for that area.","We have somewhat detailed job titles because you are automatically put into email groups and OUs depending on which job title you have, which location you're working at, and which classes you are rostered into. So a fifth grade teacher will not see the same apps on their start page as a kindergarten teacher. The ""official"" titles still go through HR though, because the contracts have pay grades specifically by various titles.  We use SSO for almost all of our apps, and both student and teacher access to each app is based on the above criteria. Automation makes life much easier.","All teachers get  Classroom Teacher - regardless of what they teach. Anyone in POL roles will get their POL title  English Learning Leader  (They used to be Head of English, but we changed that recently) But yeah normal teachers all get the same.","I'm definitely in the ""fewer titles is better"" camp. Another advantage to just having the title of ""Teacher"" and putting additional info in, say, the Department field in the District Assignment is that it makes using Staff Account Automation Rule Settings (User Management > Settings > Account Security Preferences) way easier.","This is the complete list of staff types we have.  Superintendent Principal Dean of Students Counselor Teacher Secretary ParaPro Custodian Bus Driver Transportation Director Food Service Food Service Director Technician Technology Director Coach Athletic Director Special Ed Director Curriculum Director Social Worker School Resouce Officer HR/Payroll Business Manager   We use department codes to identify subject, grade, etc.",That's HR's job to define titles and import them as is.,"Personally, for the younger grades you should just put them in as their grade level (1st grade teacher, 4th grade TA, etc.). When you get to the upper levels you can put them in as 8th Grade English, 11th Grade Science.   Also, why do your coaches need access to the SIS? Any district I've worked at has not given access. Information on the student is provided via a health sign up sheet or parent communication with coach or athletic director.",Teacher  Anything more HR can do.,"I have Teacher and Summer Teacher. I just added Summer Teacher a few weeks ago. Most of our assignments don't have anything filled in. Unless you have a reason for state reporting, fill in enough to make your job easier. That is why I added the summer teacher title, to make assignments for summer school more obvious.","You've probably already gotten a bunch of answers for this, but we recently started testing an emergency response app that hooks into our SIS and had an issue where a teacher complained that their grade level wasn't right. Turned out that their staff title had an outdated grade attached to it. Definitely just use Teacher (with the exception being TOSAs, Pre-school if applicable, RSP for intervention/Learning Center, and SpEd teachers as these can be useful for Data Validations assuming all SISs have those). You can easily understand what level (elementary, middle, high) the teacher is based on what site you've assigned them to, and Staff Assignment records can also help identifying staff roles.","Unfortunately that would require communication from HR. I'm lucky to get notified of new hires the day after they start, in most cases.",We have the coaches in the SIS for documentation and for our account creation automations,I have database access to our finance system. They are supposed to added it to a Google Sheet as well but that is a pain to deal with.,Make communication from HR happen. Meet with HR and get involved in the onboarding process. This is just a process issue that can easily be fixed.   Collaborating with colleagues in other departments should be embraced and not discounted immediately.,"HR is the entrance and the exit.

Do we have actual hard confirmation that stolen data is still in use?","And this is why you don't pay the ransom. Also, +1 for Mishka should have been fired already. They handled this so, so poorly.","Never pay the ransom.  It just encourages them more and these ransomware gangs rebrand all the time, so it's not like their reputation matters if they go back on their promises.",Received this as well. This is just fucking great.  What an absolute colossal fuckup.,Mishka McCowan should be let go.  The oversights that resulted in this happening in the first place were egregious.  The handling of the situation made it obvious that their views on cybersecurity are highly flawed (talking up VPN MFA as if internal threats are impossible).  Paying a ransom then repeatedly insisting your assurances from a criminal are valid is absurd.  It's also come to light that they still haven't improved their patching practices - they wait over a month to patch the OS on their servers.,"This is not enough.  Frank Abagnale warns that many fraudsters will wait for the two-year window to expire before launching their identity-theft schemes.   ""PowerSchool also offered and made widely available credit monitoring and identity protection services for a period of two years to students and faculty of our PowerSchool SIS customers, regardless of whether they were individually involved.""",So now ShinyHunter has ruined their credibility. I don't think they'll be getting many more ransoms paid since now we know that they are not going to delete the data after receiving the ransom payment. Stupid move on their part to not keep their word. No honor amongst thieves still rings true here.,"PowerSchool didn't send the credit monitoring offer to more than a handful of our users.   I've lost all faith in PowerSchool, we all know that you shouldn't trust a bad actor to be anything more than that.  If they are going to steal your data, you can't trust them to be honest when they say they are going to delete it.","""...a threat actor has reached out to some PowerSchool SIS customers in an attempt to extort them using data from the previously reported December 2024 incident...""   I just want to know how they are extorting them using the supposedly deleted data...  Seems like they still have the data if they are using the data to extort people...","Yes, they were provided with data samples per the news articles.",Thanks for sharing this.,">And this is why you don't pay the ransom.  I know this is an unpopular position, but immediately discarding the option of paying is the wrong approach if your goal is to minimise harm. You rely on your cybersecurity experts and insurance provider to advise on the best course of action.  Our responsibility once a ransomware attack occurs is to minimise harm within the resources we have available to us. If the expert advice is to pay, you pay if you can afford it and it can be done legally.  What are your priorities? Mine is harm minimisation.   If you're down voting this, then tell me why I'm wrong, otherwise I'm simply going to assume you care more about covering your own arse in these circumstances than harm minimisation.  I know based on theoretical discussions with counsellors and other wellbeing staff that if parts of our system which hold case notes are published, kids are likely to self-harm or even kill themselves.  If it ever happens to my school, I will not be making the recommendation, but defer to our contracted experts who know the risks and likelihood of each outcome based on which group, etc.  Unless you are a top-tier cybersecurity specialist in this area of ransomware groups, your suggestion is without merit and may result in significant harm to the children in our schools.  Do you know what is going to happen to ShinyHunters? They'll disappear. The ransomware industry is a multi-billion dollar sector and they protect it from threats like this. If people stop paying the ransom, their income disappears.  There are numerous examples of smaller groups being targeted (and frequently destroyed) by the bigger ones for causing potential victims to lose confidence in the process.  Edit: spelling/grammar","What parts do you feel were handled poorly post-breach? Aside from stating they were confident that the attackers really deleted the data, the response has been one of the better ones I’ve seen, especially for something with this large of a blast radius with such sensitive information. They missed notification deadlines for some districts’ DPAs, and some of their self-imposed deadlines for info updates were late, but still the fastest notification I’ve been a part of. If there’s more I need to be mad about, please let me know 😂",That’s why PowerSchool’s efforts to convince people their data was not still in threat actors hands was laughable. They told us with straight faces they were confident the data was gone because they paid and watched it deleted. All of our communications told stake holders to assume their data was still available online.,"Id be skeptical.  I reported a vulnerability to this company before and they didn't fix the root of the problem and kind of ghosted me when I mentioned it.  They had some testing company they acquired and would sell these scanners and some glorified scantron app that uploaded everything to their website, basically scan it and they use OCR to input grades.      They would also give you the creds for their ftp server if you asked, the creds were basically an easy combo of your state and county name, password was an IBM default ""essex""  I reached out to the next county over to ask if this was also their creds/server and they confirmed.  When i reported it, they acknowledged and just changed both county passwords and ghosted me on the follow up.  I cant remember the name of the software, but it did store some simple student data and in theory you probably could've logged in to every customer easily and deleted/modified tests on testing day.","Which articles say this?  edit: OK, I have found a couple   https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/school-districts-hit-extortion-attempts-powerschool-breach-rcna205429  I'm still fairly skeptical.","That's a reasonable take. However, I don't think you have to be a Cyber Security expert to know that *generally speaking* paying the ransom isn't advisable. This is the direct guidance of FBI, CISA, etc. I agree there are variables and every situation is different. And that if this happened to us, obviously we're going to take the advice of experts. I guess it comes down to the reputation of the TA. Clearly this one didn't care. So sure, maybe it's more nuanced than 'just don't pay it ever'... but in most situations I still think it's the recommended approach. PS essentially took your advice and still got burned. Also, how do you know that a TA isn't impersonating another TA that has a good reputation of not releasing stolen data? Pretty sure PS hired a third-party company (cybersteward.com) to negotiate with the TA. Sounds like they both got played.","You kind of said it yourself. They shouldn't have ever tried to assure customers that their data was safe, just because they paid the ransom. They blew it on all of their promised deadlines as well like you said.. the CrowdStrike report was a month and a half late (maybe even later?), the district communication was late. Was *anything* on time from them? The web conference with Mishka trying to explain what happened was awful too.  It's also within the realm of possibility that they were tipped off about this entire thing in the first place by a user on here who asked them why GB's of data from their on-prem PS instance was getting exfiltrated to a Ukranian IP. Data exfiltrated 12/19-23ish. PS isn't officially aware until 12/28 which is *after* someone on here said they had reached out with questions.",But they pinky promised!,"K12six has circulated a redacted version of the full email to members, and ShinyHunters was the culprit of the December breach. At least one district who received the mail said the data was consistent with what was exfiled.","Edit: I'm genuinely curious why this has hit such a nerve. If you disagree, please downvote **and** reply. I've been in the IT industry long enough to know I don't know everything and am open to changing my positon.  Edit edit: okay, I'll take the lack of replies as people disliking what I'm saying because it openly admits to our real position which you don't want the TAs knowing. Trust me, they already know.  >I don't think you have to be a Cyber Security expert to know that *generally speaking* paying the ransom isn't advisable.  That is correct, but isn't what you said. I have a real problem with the narrative going around that paying is never an option.  >This is the direct guidance of FBI, CISA, etc.  Also correct, but their interests are a global reduction in ransomware, and they know that in many cases paying it would be considered a crime, even if there are potential ways to get that done which make it impossible to prosecute. Their attitudes are often FAFO, so are less concerned with reducing further damage to the victim than reducing potential future ones. Read about the ACSC messing with the Medibank ransomware response for some insights into this. (Australia)   Also, govt cyber positons are almost always terribly paid so only attract true patriots and those not good enough to get a private industry job. Based on experience, there aren't a lot of patriots willing to take half salary to work for govt.  The FBI, etc are less concerned about an individual school even if release of exfiltrated data will likely cause kids to take their own lives. In my school, I've had those discussions and it is significant enough risk to include in the decison making process. It's also why 30% of my opex is spent on cybersecurity.   I'm not sure if it is similar where you are, but we are required to keep detailed case notes electronically. Those can often contain a lot of very sensitive mental health information, which is why a student could be put in a state of distress if they were published. If that isn't the case where you are, I can understand why it wouldn't be of such high concern if it were simply identity theft and grades being published.  >And that if this happened to us, obviously we're going to take the advice of experts.  Not just any experts, but experts who are paid to prioritise your interests (including the wellbeing of your students) over everyone else's.  >PS essentially took your advice and still got burned.  You followed the advice of experts, or experts who are paid to prioritise your interests? Either way, it is like any specialised area, they can get it wrong. Doesn't mean we should stop trusting people more experienced and qualified than us who are required to put our interests first.  >Also, how do you know that a TA isn't impersonating another TA that has a good reputation of not releasing stolen data?  That is why you hire experts who have the knowledge to be able to tell you.  >Pretty sure PS hired a third-party company (cybersteward.com) to negotiate with the TA. Sounds like they both got played.  We don't know if CyberSteward gave flawed advice, or the best advice they could in the circumstances.  It isn't going to change my position that I know I don't have enough experience or current knowledge to make recommendations to my school in these circumstances. I have a guy I trust entirely for this kind of situation if we ever need it. If he says pay, we'll pay.","That's absolutely fair. On the front end, the lack of hygiene that lead to the account compromise, coupled with the on-by-default remote access tool, and they definitely screwed the pooch on that side of the incident. But I guess we just have a different threshold for performance on the other side. When I compare their response to other breaches I've been notified of either as an individual or an organization, PS's was the most transparent and most timely, even if late. Even though the Crowdstrike report was late, it was still more than I've ever received from any other provider following an incident. I don't have a vested interest in defending them, but I've pointed to their response process a few times as an example for other providers to follow (but if anyone from PowerSchool is on here and wants me to have a vested interest, send check or money order to.... 😜)","Ah, thanks. I suppose nothing much I can do except wait until this information becomes public or we become a target of the breach ourselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discussion delves into PowerSchool's decision to be transparent with affected districts and hear practical advice on vendor assessments and the importance of internal security measures to minimize future threats. Reflecting on the lessons learned, Mishka discusses the steps PowerSchool has taken to bolster its security infrastructure and maintain an open communication channel with its clients.","Why weren't even the most basic security controls important enough to implement before the breach?  Let's not forget a 1099 contractor low tier support person had no auth controls past un/pw, no controls for the connecting device, and full data access to every customer.  Despite logging being in place, no log analysis or security controls existed that might have seen, I don't know, a dump of every client database from a foreign VPS IP.  SISes are sticky. Heavy lift to move, contract-based engagements, and expensive. If I could move districts away from PS, I would have. If anyone out there is evaluating an SIS, keep looking.",Let's also not forget they didn't initially have a response and it took state heads of PowerSchool to get PS to do much of anything.

I will be using Microsoft Entra as our Identity provider. All of it is cloud-hosted except for Active Directory, which is on prem.  I have downloaded the directions PowerSchool provides and I understand them. What I want to know is have you done this, and what unexpected snags did you run into that I should look out for? Give me your horror stories!  EDIT: Thanks for all the comments! The cut-over went much more smoothly than I expected. ","Just my 2 cents, not sure I'd be willing to mess with identity access to my SIS during the school year. That would definitely be a summer project where there are way fewer people needing to access it.","We've had it enabled for a few years now with Google Workspace for staff and students.  We enforce MFA for staff on their Google Workspace account, so it essentially protects PowerSchool from that aspect since it does not have MFA capability, and it gets our school folks out of the business of resetting student PowerSchool passwords.  There were no issues we ran into - it's a no brainer.","you'll want to do an import manager automation to read a flat file from a sftp server to get oidc updated (assuming you have automation for user creation). i dont know the details as my 'app team' runs powerschool but i run the identity management workflow. for a while they were having to manually update the oidc field everytime a new user was created, because you cant update oidc with autocomm, but you can with import manager.","If you have a test server, I would set it up there first just to make sure you have all of your ducks in a row.","We did this about four years ago.  The only horror stories I can share with you are the ones we had before switching to OIDC. Staff needing constant password resets because they somehow forgot it. Locking themselves out of their accounts. etc etc etc.  SSO everything.  I guess the only warning I can give you is you’re about to find out which staff members are sharing their PowerSchool credentials, like to student teachers or the like. But that’s a problem worth confronting and solving.","We moved to OIDC (Google - can’t speak to entra) over a spring break a year or so ago, was smooth and nobody really noticed. Just less typing. We have it on for staff, students and admin portal. Parents still have to login the old way",PowerSchool really screws you by making you reauthenticate 100000 times per day- basically they don’t trust Entra. It’s a PITA.    https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1d9fqmo/powerschool_mishandling_timeouts_with_237x_and/,My administrators are paranoid since the incident in January. They gave the okay to disrupt access for a week and I have a roll-back plan.,This is commonly overlooked. It can be a touch tricky to get all of the pieces automated but you can do it relatively easily if you know where to look. Make sure you prepare for this OP,Same with us. It's not all that big of a deal. Especially since you can import the IDs with scheduled imports these days.  Get all your IDs in there. You can then turn it on for your different groups in stages if you want. We did students first. Worked out the bugs. Then staff. Then teachers last.,The issue with PowerSchool in December wouldn't have been mitigated with OIDC. That said I do think it's worth capitalizing on the paranoia to make positive changes to the system while you have that momentum. Sometimes a couple months pass and everyone forgets and gets complacent again. We moved to OIDC years ago using Google as the identify provider. I don't recall ever hitting any major snags.

Or is this everywhere?,rjp94sep,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1j44mfa/," It’s a snow day here so I’m jumping on here to vent something I’ve been mulling over for a few months now.  I’m so torn and filled with imposter syndrome because this is my first K12 IT job, so I’m not sure if this is normal or its insane. I’m a 1-person department so I can’t even infer with a “co-worker” who isn’t in the trenches with me. I need you to help me if this is just me or if its a “Welcome to K12 IT” problem.  For context, I am in Minnesota. It is an urban K-8 Public Charter. Roughly 500 kids in person, 300 online. I make $74k, salaried, so I cannot timesheet for overtime.  * I’m in charge of everything. I know this is a lot of people that say “everything that plugs in” but literally staff refer to me as the “Technology Expert.” We have an MSP that does our Internet and Firewall. They are supposed to help with tickets, but when half of them have never heard of Securely or Clever, or can’t touch PowerSchool for PPI reasons, I’m doing most of the Tier 1 desk stuff anyway. * And yet I know I’m making $6k less than my predecessor who didn’t have any training. I have in the last year gotten my CompTIA Plus, Google Admin Cert, and “Clever Trainer” and “Google Trainer” certified. All on my own time and dime. * Last year it was my predecessor AND me (Help Desk). When they fired him and asked me to step up (IT Manager), they said they would get a “me” replacement. It is almost a year and that has still yet to happen. * I had a meeting with HR about having people needing to use the ticket system. She tells me I have the right to tell people they need to use the ticket system. Next day, she turns around, calls me. I remind her, she says “I’m proud of you for reinforcing it!” Doesn’t send a ticket. Then stops me in the hall 2 days later and asks the same thing.        * \^\^I have had this conversation now 2 more times with her and nothing has changed. * I am seen over by the Director of Ops who barely understands email. But he’s not only my supervisor. He’s also in charge of transportation, and attendance, and he’s also the Middle School Assistant Principal. Since December he’s only talked to me for 5 hours total when we are supposed to have two 1 hour meetings a week.       * I also have to go through him for every financial purchase. From $10 to $10k, I need his signature. * They make tech decisions about platforms/apps/security hardware/which projectors they are going to buy but don’t include me in the conversation. And then 3-4 months later, they are surprised why XYZ project isn’t rolling out smoothly.  I’m so lost at what to do. I love this kind of work. I love the problem solving. I love that I’m helping kids and not some corporate hedge fund. But the lack of professionalism is infuriating to me. The fact that I am the one who has to drag this place kicking and screaming into the 21st Century is giving me migraines. The idea that I have to quarterback its operational maturity and not, oh I don’t know, Admin/Leadership. And the biggest mental hurdle: I’m putting in 55-60 hours a week just to keep my head above water, for what I know is lower 10% of the pay for a Tech Director in Minnesota, with probably 4 times the staff on their IT Department payroll.  So, what do I do?  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1j44mfa)","I work in a much larger environment, and experience very few of these issues. Each district is it's own entity, though. Might be time to look for a different K12 job if this place is running you into the ground.  Alternatively, you could force the 40-hour work week. What doesn't get done doesn't get done. When people start asking you, you tell them there are only so many hours in a day. The #1 thing that I see in K12 IT which I think is happening to you is that nobody sees or cares about the workload as long as everything is getting done. The moment it isn't getting done, someone will start paying attention, and asking why. Now, if you do this and they still aren't willing to get you help and start demanding you work 60-hour weeks, it's probably time to consider moving on. I'm sure there are other K12 positions available.","""Here are the things that need to change.  If we cannot negotiate these things then you (the school) and I both need to start looking for other options.""","A.  Yeah, that is IT in K12.  B.  They are only going to solve the top 12 LOUDEST problems.  You are not being a squeaky wheel enough.  Demand a raise, demand a helper.","When I started in K12  IT (back in the dark ages) I was the IT department.  K-12 district, 2 buildings, \~1200 students.  I brought email into the district and Google was not a thing at that time.  After months of 10-12 hour+ days while living an hour away, the Superintendent took me aside and told me to stop killing myself.  He said that if I continued to work these hours it would become expected and no one would appreciate my efforts.  He told me to work a reasonable day with the understanding that some days might be 10 hours but others would be 6-7.  He also told me to take every vacation day I was given and not leave any on the table - we could not carry them over.    Going forward, you need to have a plan for you.  Do you like it there?  If yes, start working to make changes.  Phrase all requests/demands in a way that makes them see it as a solution.  Put in writing that you woudl like a seat at the table for project planning.  The reason being is that it will lead to smoother rollouts and allow roadblocks to be anticipated ahead of time.  Put in writing that you need tickets.  The reason being is that it will help keep track of issues and resolve them quicker.   An example might be if you suddenly see 10 tickets for ""Y"" issue you might realize that it is something with a firewall, vs going to a classroom because a teacher called or caugth you in the hall.    Document what you are doing that a lower teir tech could take off your plate.  Keep track of what you could be doing that a lower level tech couldnt.  Use that data to present your case for an assistant.  If the MSP has a contract to provide Teir 1 support, but cant because they are not familiar with your enviroment, propose restructuring the contract becasue they are not providing what you are paying for.  Use the savings for a helper.  For financial, I am the iT Director in a much larger system and every purchase has to have a PO and and be approved by our Director of Business.  What I have done to make it easier is get blanket POs to both Amazon and CDWG approved so if I need $30 with of cables or a battery I dont have to go theough the PO process everytime and can just buy using the blanket PO number.  I can spend up to the total of the PO before i have to get a new one.       If you dont like it there you can use this job as a skills builder and start applying elsewhere.  I strongly suggest trying to make changes while you look elsewhere though, and certainly dont act like you have one foot out the door.    One thing I have found about education is that change tends to happen VERY slowly in school IT.   IT will never be the primary focus of a school and will often be seen as an afterthought, until it does not work.  Then its ""Its always broken""  Acceptance of new IT people and procedures will be grudgingly slow, but with patience, time, and support from admin, change can be made.   I would not go back to my former job, even with the better salary it would likely pay, for anything.  I find schools to be a very family oriented place that emphasize work-life balance and I am glad I took the time in both districts I have been in to shape the perception of what IT in a school should be.    Your mileage may vary","I would have fight for the following:  Purchase power on basic supplies | a stipend for trainings | lvl 1 assistant  If your title was director I would say fight for more, but since it's manager stay the course a while, push for the title change, and then with a title change to Director you'll have more ground to make some more demands.   Secondly, if you feel the workload is too much you have two options.   1) push yourself further until you burn out. There is no ""get gud"", continue to prove you are compenent enough to do everything and it will just be the expectation.   2) Be OK with failing at some things. You won't get the support you need if they think you can handle everything on your own. Prioritize what must be done, let the rest fall to the MSP (helpdesk wise). if they don't pick up the slack don't do it for them. The people in charge will notice eventually, and if it's contracted, they are the point of failure, not you.  Also... Take care of the HR lady. Some positions need to be the exception for a smoother working environment. for me it's HR, Heads Office, CFO, and food services.   If you are working education IT for the love of learning and the environment of working around students stay the course. If you are doing it for the money, education is not the right market for you. Non-profits are also notoriously low paying. Double score if you can work for an educational non-profit.   Good luck!","You got thrown in the deep end, and you're going to learn a ton. My predecessor bought every wiz-bang gadget out there (one of the reasons he is no longer there is due to his spending problem) and I had to undo a lot of it. I am a one-man department, too, and it took me about two years to unravel it all. You are going to learn A TON. I would keep your toe out there for better situations, but you will also gain fantastic experience going through what you are going through now. I am 10x the tech guy I was in 2020. Take it from someone who is now on the other side of that. Good luck!","What kind of relationship do you have with your Superintendent? Because it sounds to me that you should sit down and flush out this post with more detail and then setup a meet w/ them and discuss it in more detail. Outline the issues you have here, but focus on how they are hurting the district as a whole and ultimately leading to a negative student experiences. Ask them for more money and more autonomy as well as a seat at the table for all tech stuff.   Based on how that conversation goes, and if anything changes between now and the end of the school year (so about 3 or so months) you can make a solid decision. If this all falls on deaf ears, or you get a ton of empty promises, then start looking to move elsewhere. The summer is when most districts are hiring.","I made 40k at my last job as a k12 admin before i left. It was a small school with only a few hundred kids though. I was the only tech obviously.   I typically find its one tech for every thousand students. My current job we have 1700 kids, 2 techs me and a help desk. At one point it was only me for a couple years. I'll break 100k in salary next year. My helpdesk guy makes 60k.    There's a few things I'll note. Location matters. Another district tech near me with simular enrollment makes 30k more then I do. The town is more development and recieves more in taxes. It is what it is. He's also been there for a good amount of time. He's a well season k12 tech and well worth it imo. People in the area look up to him because of the years of experience.  Our district allows us to spend up to 10k on individual purchases as long as its in the budget. That's a good amount of freedom. We know our budgets and can closely monitor them through our accounting system. Anything over 10k  I would need a procurement committee or the board to approve these purchases prior to buying. Larger purchaes they require me to get at least three quotes.   The questions in the hall are normal. We call this halljacking.  We typically say we are busy and we'll come back around or ask the user to put in a ticket. I generally do not respond to request in emails. This kinda forces them to put in a ticket. If they ask I generally tell them it's probably lost in my inbox which is a blackhole.  With 2 techs (me and helpdesk) in our district there's moments we are really busy. However I will say there's also times where we are bored. I also have a pretty good helpdesk guy which also helps.  So its not like I have to monitor him or teach him on how to handle end user stuff.  He has the knowledge of a system admin. The only limitation is he's generally stuck doing helpdesk stuff. Obviously I have to focus more on servers, budgeting, and administrative work.   Welcome to k12. If you really don't like it you can always switch to another business or school.  My first k12 job was 13.50 a hour when I was right out of college. I gradually moved up to where I'm at know.   This might be harsh. Just because your certified in Google, clever, comptia it doesn't mean more pay. These are basic certification that most people can achieve with a couple years of experience. I don't even go for these certs anymore. I just know I'm expected to know these things. I have the old comptia certs before they expired. Microsoft certs, etc. My work does not reimburse or require me to obtain these certs. If they did I would still do these but at this point I'd more focus more on higher level certs ccna, azure, etc.  I'm not trying to knock them though. I just look at them as small achievements. I'm definitely not putting those in my email signatures.","Hi, I'm in a public school in a suburb of Minneapolis. Our team consists of one director, 4 admins, 2 database admins, and various levels of desktop support. I am one of the admins and make $84k a year. I only deal with Apple/Jamf things, and I have never worked over 40 hours a week.  I worked 6 years at another public school very close to Minneapolis, and made $64k as lead desktop support when I left.  In my opinion, knowing Twin Cities' payrate, you are being underpaid to be in charge of everything, even for 500 in person students.","I'm a bit torn. It seems like a shitshow, but if you can pull it off, you can make a pretty nice workplace.  I am the sole person in a 500 student district, 2 schools, K-8. When I came onboard the place was broken. Tech wasn't updated in years, support requests were ignored, and no long term plan. Plus, the position reported to multiple people who all had separate projects/goals.  First, I met with the superintendent and changed the org chart so I reported to one person - the superintendent. Since my projects impact two buildings, I needed to be able to prioritize projects on my schedule - not the principals. They were PISSED - but oh well.  Next, I worked with the super to come up with a three year plan to get the district back on track. I laid out what needed to be done, when it needed to be done, and how much it would cost. I was now in charge of tech deployments - if it wasn't on my list, it wasn't going to get done. No more pet projects I didn't know about. If principals wanted something they needed to come to me to have it added to the list - and since budget was tied to it, they couldn't just request random projects without impacting something else.  Third, I implemented a ticket system that helped me keep track of requests and made sure that I wasn't stopped every few feet inside the school with tech requests. No ticket - no repair.  It took YEARS for everything to come together, but now my district runs smoothly, I'm part of the monthly admin meetings, have a spot at the school board meetings and they listen to me, and only answer to the superintendent. My pay is over $150K and I work about 40 - 50 hours a week, which for me is a manageable amount. I do not hold any certs but do have a EdD.   All that being said - I spent time in a classroom as a teacher and still maintain my sub license. In my experience that helps me a lot when dealing with admin and staff. As soon as the ""You don't know what it's like..."" starts, I can shut that down really quick.",">She tells me I have the right to tell people they need to use the ticket system. Next day, she turns around, calls me. I remind her, she says “I’m proud of you for reinforcing it!” Doesn’t send a ticket. Then stops me in the hall 2 days later and asks the same thing.  If you can get it in writing (such as email) that tech requests should be submitted through the ticket system, then when someone *doesn't* do that  * Ask them to submit a ticket * You should feel no obligation to fulfill requests that have not been sent through the proper channels  If you can't get it in writing that requests should be structured (for everyone's sake - yours, requesters, and supervisors), and there are enough of them that it's a problem (which it sounds like it is), then it's probably not a place to continue working at.","I'm at a K12 private school, making similar, but in California. I am the entire IT Department, and I have around 1300 students across two campuses. This is my first Admin job after going back to school and working support for 3 years at a medium-sized business. My predecessor did a good job upgrading the system, and I have friends I call when I need advice. I report directly to the superintendent and don't typically exceed 40 hours. I can make my own purchases up to $500, but I don't usually have any trouble getting approval. The money is hard here in California for sure, but I'm in a good working environment, so I don't have any immediate plans for leaving. There are definitely things about your situation that sound difficult, but it might be worth it to stay for a few years, even if just for the experience and relatively decent pay. Especially if you can find ways to keep your hours manageable.","I work in a similar environment, and I'm hopefully going to become the IT Manager after my co-worker retires. I am thankful that my boss (also Ops director) worked in my position before moving up, so he gets it (and is close to my age).  People are never going to be fully happy with you, so if YOU aren't getting bad feedback or getting blamed for things, then I think it would be worth sticking it out. I feel the same way that I'm glad I'm here and not in some massive office park.  I would focus right now on trying to get a seat at the table. If you're going to be servicing and maintaining everything, you should be chiming in. ALSO, try to get your school to pay for any more education. My boss bought me a platform where I got my google cert. Those are perks that make the education salary a little easier to stomach. Sometimes there is a ""professional development"" budget.","I think these are all very common in K12. You've got a lot of good advice here, and I'll just jump on the bandwagon. The pay is never going to be what you want in education. It is, however, something you can negotiate. I strongly recommend tracking your time and your accomplishments. Periodically send them to your boss in a bullet-pointed email, especially if you're not meeting often. It's also important to be firm (but polite!) with users. Refuse to tackle problems without a ticket - tickets are the evidence that you're making progress in a chaotic system. Tickets also allow you to focus on the biggest problems, which will suffer without good organization. I would also reserve at least 10-20% of your time for systemic problems. These don't get attention, because they aren't immediate crises, but will more than pay off in the long term. They also look great in a progress report (or a resume). With a few big-picture fixes behind you, it's easy to make a case for how much money or time you are saving the school, and how it would be a shame if they had to train up someone else to start from scratch. And always, always, be picking up new skills. Because you never know.","Greetings fellow Minnesotan. Sounds like bog-standard K12 IT to me. I worked for a K12 district of similar size, and they didn't even want to pay me 60k, so I jumped ship to an even more rural school half the size for 70k.   You've got to advocate for yourself and get admin behind you. Burning yourself out by working a ton of overtime won't get you any help, it'll just make staff whine more once you slow down amidst burnout. Unless you set a deadline and say you'll have a task done by that day, screw working overtime.   If they want to drag their feet on replacing your previous help desk position, then they don't deserve you working above and beyond your contractually obligated to working hours. If they have an issue, then kindly remind them that work wouldn't be piling up if they finally replaced the helpdesk. But also don't do shoddy work and give them an excuse to say you're slacking off to get help hired. Do good work, but only between your set 8-hour workday.","I'm the everything at my place. Network, Wireless, Desktop, Azure, Google, NetSec, Firewall admin. Prolly forgetting a few, oh I also manage our fleet of 460+ iPads using Mosyle. I make 50k a year. When I first started I was like you, working 50-60 hours a week. It's not sustainable, you need to find a way to turn it off after a certain time. Use your time there to pad your resume.","Well applying for new jobs now is a nightmare but I will say this, you are getting payed double what I got paid for 3 years, I too was the only person working at a smallish schoo like yourself and the MSP provided firewall and network support.       I would fight for a place at the table making decisions related to technology, you need to make the argument that you need to be part of budgeting and expense as you will ultimately be responsible and need to be able to setup a timeline on how things integrate and need to let them know it should be tested or at least reviewed first for compatibility, this is all in effort for them to see you more than what they see you as now which is a glorified grounds keeper or custodial service for technology and get them to see you as an IT Director, they need to see you as the guy that speaks the language they have no idea about, and yes imposter syndrome is very very very real here because to be quite honest nothing prepares you for this unless you are working at an MSP for a long time.  Also it looks amazing on your future resume that you were in charge of IT for an org for x amount of years so i say stick with it till it affects your mental or physical health",The more I read it the worse it gets. You're working more than 40 hours a week despite everything you said? You should put a hard stop on them at 40 hours a week.  CYA everything. Get the HELL out. They literally don't care.,"Don't leave (yet). Start applying for jobs. Ask for more money. Fight, but not before you find an ally in admin. Document roll-out issues caused by planning IT systems without the input of actual IT people and use that information as a weapon in the fight. Don't work more than 40 hours a week. It's K12 IT - nobody will die if it doesn't get completed today.   This is coming from 26 years in K12 IT in NY (state, not city).","I don't know how your pay scales work, but here we have collective bargaining, so your pay should be set based on your job. If it isn't make sure you're on the right scale or file for a reclassification. This applies to our dependent charters, too. If you're short on staff, they may be able to pay you a stipend, such as a 4% for extra duties.  Minor point that may not apply, but being salaried doesn't mean you're ineligible to get OT. There are both salary non-exempt (must get OT) or salary exempt that are still sometimes paid for OT.  Regarding the tickets, don't be afraid to say that you need to work from tickets but you can help them input one. Even if you create the ticket in their name, they'll at least get use to getting updates from tickets. If someone asks for help (and it's not just a quick question), ask for their ticket number. If they don't have one, ask for the details and create a ticket for them right then and then work on their request. They need to see that it's a benefit to create one and they aren't going to get around it.  Try not to work tons of extra hours indefinitely. It's not unusual, and I did 50 hour weeks for years, but it's better to be frank about your timeline and when you'll get to things. If you do a budget, try to include additional staffing. If you think an intern can help, see if you can hire a half-time intern at a lower wage.  Sounds like you have a lot of opportunity to learn. Try to learn the business side of K-12 education as well.","Just so everyone knows, technology in K-12 is going to get worse before it gets better.  Especially in MN.  Levys and referendums aren’t passing and no one cares about technology when teachers salary’s are at stake.  You will lose every time.     I have lost almost all my staff with no reduction in workload and administration just tells me to work more hrs.  It’s a shit-show.   Large districts seem less this this way, but so many are.   Every thing you mention here is common practice.    The good thing with k-12 is that we get to work on so many things the corporate world will never let you touch unless you are an experienced “certified” professional.","If you need help, we are a K-12 focused provider that goes well beyond the standard MSP. We can do the project stuff, the MSP maintenance stuff, but we also do mentoring and training for co-managed staff, handle escalations, provide leadership (fractional CIO/IT Dir. that have decades of experience as W-2 employees in districts; we know what Securly and Clever are), help with policies, customized training for staff, creating technology plans, visions, and actually executing them with a direct focus on everything technology being measured by how it impacts student outcomes.  We had a brand new IT tech (never had a tech job before) start at a 1400 student district this year. He's crushing it 'all by himself'. He's getting daily training on everything he needs to know, help with tickets as needed, and mentoring to eventually become the IT Director for the district. We are doing all of that (and more) after taking on the outgoing provider's contract w/o raising it at all.  Happy to chat. We don't have any sales people, so there's no pressure either way.","I made $40k from 2010-2018 in a situation almost identical to yours.   I wouldn't have traded the experience for the world. It was the most enjoyable work environment I could have ever hoped for - hindsight being 20/20.   I'd at least try to learn, grow in confidence and see if you can win their trust.   Just my two cents.","Be patient and help them understand. Keep communicating and doing your best. At the same time, keep growing, expand your skills, earn more certifications, and apply for better-paying jobs. When the time is right, you’ll know. They can either give you a raise, or you can move on (and it sounds like that will be the best choice for you, this is too small of an org).","With that salary and size, not sure I would be complaining.","Welcome!  I was in the same boat when I started.K-8 public charter with around 400 students and 60 staff.  Still in the same boat now but 8 years later, I've made the boat a bit better.  Getting an admin to work with and trust you is half the battle.  Once you can get someone to see the light by showing them how smooth things can go when you are included, it tends to make a big difference.  IT is typically an afterthought for most.","If you don't mind me asking, in your opinion with knowing the MN It K12 landscape, what should I push to get paid for next year if I stay? I'm thinking $88k as a first offer to see if they come down to meet me at 82? Or am I high-balling? Not enough?","For real, I'm the ISO and Network Admin at a K-12 with 3500 students and I'm making like 46k.

26,2025-02-21 22:51:22,What I think about the PowerSchool breach and its implications,SpecialistArm4741,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1ivbwjq/,"What I think is this that breach highlights a failure not just in protecting data but in implementing basic security practices. It doesnt necessarily mean PS didn’t encrypt its data, but it suggests they didn’t use data segregation or robust role based access control RBAC. These would have limited the impact by ensuring only authorized users from a specific school or district could access their data. If PS had used unique encryption keys per school, only people from School B could see their data, and the same for School C. District admins would have access only to their district’s data. This approach, combined with RBAC and authorization layers, wouldve improved their security posture and compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and FERPA. Ignoring these standards shows poor data handling and a disregard for regulatory frameworks IDK. The fact that stolen credentials granted access to a wide range of data suggests this might have been a company level credential breach. Such credentials often have broad privileged access for maintenance or support, which, when exploited, can be devastating big time. This points to a lack of proper segregation of duties and principle of least privilege. Poor implementation is also evident if their admin panel had vulnerabilities, like weak authentication, lack of MFA, or flaws such as insecure APIs. If attackers could impersonate an admin or bypass login mechanisms, encryption wouldnt help they’d still get full database access easily just like that. What could be the result? Beyond reputational damage, schools might rethink contracts with PS platform if you think about it. Stricter government regulations could follow, mandating better security for student data systems. For PowerSchool, this is a wakeup call and robust security isn’t optional, and ignoring it undermines trust and compliance.      thoughts?",I mean at the basic level they shouldn’t have had a maintenance account with full access with no MFA. Then how about having an alert for a script running to exfiltrate that amount of data?,"I am guessing that your organization was not part of the breach, and you don’t have access to the info they provided at the start.   Or your higher ups have not provided you with all the info if your org is part of the breach.   (this is based on what your are guessing/theorizing at)  I don’t think encryption would have done much, if anything, since the data was extracted via an export process from within the application, a normal process that probably occurs daily in many organizations.     Could that export process  have encryption on the exported data, possibly.   Would that mean 200 workstations need the encryption key to access that data, yes  (some orgs would need less, some more).","PowerSchool is scrambling: 1) We still have not received the CrowdStrike report (was supposed to be to clients around Jan 17th, month later nothing).   2). In Aug 2024 they stated that 23.12 was going to be supported until Aug 2025 and the new State Reporting (released Feb 18) requires 24.3 and fails on install inside of 23.12; only a note in the release notes about this, everywhere else it states 23.12 is still supported, including the State Reporting download page.  No email to tech contacts on account about this, found out this week while we where on break and had to do an emergency upgrade yesterday.  3) Maintenance account access enabled by default until the latest 24.3 released at the beginning of Feb 2025.  4) No MFA or location access policies to the ""maintenance account system"" until recently; how did these guys pass their insurance audits?   I can't even pass mine without this on my admin accounts.   It's a complete cluster f*CK; between the lawsuits, governments (States, Prov, USA, and Canada) looking at it;  I don't see them surviving as a company.","My thoughts: What a coincidence that this happens right after their acquisition by Bain Capital. Powerschool was fine for a long time, then shortly after their new ownership get the keys and surely starting to ""find efficiencies"", they are breached.   Of course we don't know the full situation, but I suspect the security community will get wakeup call after wakeup call but still have to hand over the keys to some suits and some ""security guys"" they know who did it cheaper at the other companies they acquired. Without the transparency you'd get with a publicly owned company, they can do whatever sounds good at the moment.  I think stricter government regulations would be a great start, but I just don't think congress is really capable of doing a good job of it. It would be a tough law to write in the first place, and there's always pressure to get security for cheaper to pump up valuations when a breach probably won't happen under any given current leadership's watch. Also, congress would probably want to give the government a ""backdoor"" to the data anyway. For ""large moat"" b2b/b2g companies like this, I wouldn't be surprised to see them spend more on cyber insurance than they do on hardening their systems. After all, have you heard of a single school actually dumping PS and moving to a competitor after this?   At the end of the day, Bain and other private equity companies have different (shorter term...) goals than a company like this should. The problem is structural: different incentives for leadership than people like you and I whose data was taken. Maybe I'm just a socialist, but I think the long-term solution  might be employee-owned companies where profits are shared and leadership is incentivized to see security as an investment rather than an expense. Since there won't be a majority of the stakeholders ""exiting"" at any one time, it always makes sense to do the right thing for the future.",">4) No MFA or location access policies to the ""maintenance account system"" until recently; how did these guys pass their insurance audits? I can't even pass mine without this on my admin accounts.  Last I heard, they still don't have this.  They cut off access from the outside so their work from home employees need to VPN in with MFA to get to it.  That isn't the same thing in my eyes since it won't help if someone is already inside their network.",you think the cause of the breach was not there BEFORE the acquisition?       June 2024 - acquisition announced     October 2024 - acquisition completed     December 2024 - breach occurred,Yeah. That access vector has existed for a VERY long time.,"We'll never know fan sure, but yes, I think it's very likely. Private equity isn't exactly known for making cost cutting charges once they get control.",That was /s right? It seems a common trend for private equity to cut corners as much as they can to maximize their profits while they suck their latest acquisition dry. Granted in this instance its unlikely any initial cuts were the cause and the issue existed before the acquisition.,Sounds like we agree that all we can do is guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,2025-02-19 15:26:25,"Powerschool SIS - Security, Responsibility, Best Practice, and what have you got?",combobulated,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1itikdo/,"Apologies for another Powerschool post - I suspect many of you (like me) are honestly tired of hearing/dealing with Powerschool ANYTHING at this point.  Wall of text incoming - thanks for those who survive to the end.  But as I continue diving into things on our end, I'm finding more and more issues and have more and more questions.    Like most other PS users, we were part of the recent massive data breach they had.  (We're 100% hosted).  That was the catalyst to looking deeper into all things Powerschool here.  And I'd also bet that another similarity to many others is that in our school, Powerschool has been around for a long time (15+ years here) and has passed through the hands of many ""administrators"" .  For us (a small, private school with about 400 current students and ~100 active staff) Powerschool has mostly been a ""school administration"" asset.  The IT department helped with some of the initial setup and working on grades and such (long ago) but overall support and maintenance was part of our then Technology Coordinator's job.  Just shy of a decade ago, we had turnover at that position and the Powerschool duties were primarily put into the hands of our school Administrative Assistant. There was an informal agreement at that time that no one else would be entering data related to users (staff/students) so that we didn't have issues with knowing who did what.    And that's where it sat for several years.  In the IT Department, we never touched Powerschool.  If someone had a PS question/issue, I'd direct them to the Administrative Assistant. Our current Technology Coordinator would sometimes act as a backup support person if the AA was unavailable.   AA attended several trainings and seemed to have a grasp on the day-to-day operation of Powerschool for our needs.  Not sure if you can already see the problem coming here or not.  Anyway, fast forward to the breach last month.  Suddenly, lots of higher-up people here have a whole lot of questions and concerns about PS and how we use it.  Most started with ""Well, who ""owns"" it here?  Who is in charge? Who's our expert?"" (perhaps code-word for ""whose fault is this?""...) and of course IT was part of those meetings to hear and respond to  questions.    It makes some sense - on one hand, it IS data. And in general that'd lump into ""This is the IT Department's responsibility"".  But I explained that IT has had basically nothing to do with it for probably over a decade.  It's immediately clear that our AA has no real idea how any of it works outside of the simple checklist she may follow to complete her assigned tasks.  So now we (our 2 person IT Department - Me SysAdmin and a Helpdesk tech) are involved again trying to gather information as it pertains to this particular breach.    It's quickly clear that I'm shining light on things that haven't seen light in a long, long time.  Questions that I had for our AA had no answer (""Who entered this data?"" ""Why is this data here?"" ""What's the practice for removing data?).  We learn that some staff have all sorts of PII in Powerschool - the full bit, SSN, DOB, Address, Phone, Email, etc.  About 1/3 of them.  And no one knows why - we don't need/use any of that data in Powerschool.  It's likely some past employee was entering it (likely with good intentions) years ago.  So I'm stuck trying to figure out what we have, what we need, what was compromised, and how to clean it up moving forward.  A simple question of ""Well, who has admin access?"" is suddenly not so simple as I dig in...  I ask our AA about Security Groups in PS - and she has no idea what I'm talking about.  I ask about user roles and permissions - again, not anything she's familiar with.  I ask about page permissions - nope.  I ask about any routine/practice for handling terminated staff - it's not consistent or formally documented.    And I learn that with Powerschool, you simply CAN'T remove records.  I can't delete users. Can't delete groups. You can mark them as ""inactive"".  Outside of that, I plan on just ""blanking"" or filling in fields with gibberish instead of actual PII.  Ok, so there must be some other built-in pruning/cleaning/wiping/overwriting process, right?  Nope.  Maybe there's a 3rd party tool?  Otherwise, better get comfortable with the art of creating report queries and exporting data to CSV files to then edit and re-import.  And plan on building a process/policy that plans on doing that manually at whatever regular interval you feel is sufficient.  I've been banging my head against the wall here.  The Powerschool Community is so hit-and-miss with data that I haven't gotten much value out of it,  But I'm not sure where else to turn (hence, this too long post...).  Our ""rep"" that reached out shortly after the breach has provided just about zero assistance with my specific questions.   And as I'm spending hours attempting to learn the ins and outs of Powerschool - plus put that in context of how we use it and our practices  - it again dawns on me that it's still not formally my responsibility.  Much of the time I feel like I'm just the middle man : Powerschool says XYZ - so I go to our AA and ask about XYZ and they either know nothing about it or give their limited understanding in context of how the school handles it.  Then I go back and try to put the pieces together.  So I feel like I'm not learning someone else's job...  I don't have an issue if PS is clearly marked as part of my job description and reasonability.  But I don't want to find myself walking on thin ice of someone else's frozen pond of mistakes.  So how are you handling it? How is it at your school (bonus points if you're a small /private school)?  Whose job/responsibility/accountability is your SiS?   Do you have policy in place for addressing data security, retention, and PII as it relates to Powerschool (or any other hosted platform!)  Would you be willing to share it?  How are you handling retention in a system that doesn't allow deletion of records??  Is it an IT thing at your school? How are you auditing things like permissions and users? *Are* you auditing them?  Is there a better place for Powerschool Admins/experts/wanna-be learners to converse?   Does anyone use Veracross (https://www.veracross.com/) as their SiS?  I hadn't heard of them previously, but I've heard good things about their security approach. I'm afraid going with a smaller SiS will limit our integrations and available tools.  (Not that I'm sure there's a change in SiS in our future anyway...)  Anyway - it all leads into a quest for resources to do a full data security audit - one that must include 3rd party hosted/cloud platforms. As it is, I don't know what's in the software platforms used by Food service, accounting, facilities, or any other department as they each operate in their own (3rd party, cloud) data silos.  We'd gladly pay for an Expert to come in and facilitate that.  But I can't find such a thing.  Sure, general ""cyber security"" audits, pen testing, etc are common.  But we've done that and they don't cover this particular item.","PowerSchool is 100% Technology responsibility. Sure, we have clerical that enters attendance, does schedules, etc; but everything is under the control of the technology department.   If they need support, it comes from us. If they need training, it comes from us.   We control all users, and limit access as much as possible. There are only two people with SysAdmin roles - everyone else is limited to their needs.   Teachers see grades, attendance, and contract info. Clerical staff doesn’t have access to grades (except the registrar). Nurses have access to medical and contact info, but not grades, etc.  Every security group is controlled as strictly as we can.   Join the PSUG group, and read the archives. You’ll learn a lot! Like anything in tech, you have to use it to understand all the unique issues.   Every SIS is terrible. lol. They all have their issues. PowerSchool is actually one of the better evils. I previously used SkywardSMS and will take PowerSchool any day! I’ve heard great things about InfiniteCampus too, but have never used that one personally.","Simply put, in education, the IT director/equivalent is typically considered the data steward.  Meaning, like it or not, it may not have been your bag of crap until now, but it is now.  You can't fix what you didn't know should have been your issue, BUT you can develope a plan to fix it moving forward.  You can purchase Key to Ownership training directly from PowerSchool, or pay for specific training.  Now, that said, seek the powerschool user's group - https://groups.io/g/PSUG  There is a national/regional PSUG training you can check into -  https://easyregpro.com/psugevents Cheaper to attend than the official training.  And powerschool's PowerSchool University - https://psu.powerschool.com/  Mass change fields like SSN to clear unless your state requires it for some reason. You'll want to search all records.  Just tackle it one issue at a time.","When we implemented, it was in the tech department. The person in charge didn't do a very good job, and I ended up learning the system and finishing the implementation because someone needed to do it.  I did not have a background in tech, but I did have a background in data through my psychology degrees. I taught myself all of the coding needed to build our customizations. Again, because someone needed to do it.  Whose department it is doesn't really matter, but someone needs to own it. If your school is playing a giant game of alligator arms about who is in charge, then everyone loses.","IT should be responsible for the systems (maintaining, security etc), but users/depts should be responsible for the data (creating, verifying, removing etc). IT is the data steward, but depts/users are the data owners - they decide who the data should be shared with, not IT. IT just executes.  There should also be admin-approved policies and procedures that ensure data integrity and confidentiality are being addressed.   Yes, PS has no ability to remove data, but you can zero values out by overwriting them (this is still a problem because your local storage will just continue to grow over time).   You can't really do proper Data Retention on it, and forcing users to download CSVs just leaves copies of PII on workstations which conflicts with the principle of data minimization. You can schedule the archiving/wiping to be done in summer after the SY ends and before the new one starts.  Some schools have a PowerSchool Administrator position that does all the reports generation and data manipulation and even customization.  I see the word 'audit' thrown around a lot, but it means different things to different people - i've even seen a consultancy say they do a non-technical audit (which means they just look at your policies and procedures). in my own opinion, an audit is a formal attestation against a standard - like ISO 27001. Technically even NIST CSF is not an audit standard.  What you want is likely a Security Assessment, but you need to define the scope. It doesn't have to be an assessment of everything - you can break it up - patch management, cloud security posture, identity and access/permissions management, vulnerability management etc.  Schools should be doing this already, given the kind of data they have access to. Unfortunately no one really cares until something bad happens.","I inherited a similar system from a tech director that had a 'caretaker' role in PS rather than a leadership role.  If one school needed something specific, he added it.  There was no effort to coordinate ANYTHING, ever...  First thing I did was go to PSUG conferences and dig in, two conferences a year.  Each time I brought back more info on security, roles, and everything in between.  Then I cut off everyone's access and built it up from the ground up, all the while learning what each person did and what they needed in PS.    Along the way, you'll learn more about how it works and what you need to do.","Phew! Lots to digest here but I totally can relate to the frustrations here.  So, a lot of your core issues are procedural, and especially in small environments procedures are virtually non existent and it’s a long road to get them setup with some gnashing of teeth the whole way.   Let’s start with “what is everyone else doing”  Well, I’ve seen it lots of ways. But in my experience the SIS being owned by a specific department dedicated to SIS data, enrollments, state compliance, scheduling, and all of the course hoopla to go along with it works best. There is a whole discipline dedicated to making that work smoothly that I can promise you the IT department wants nothing to do with.  Now, that being said IT absolutely should be involved in setting up procedure for secure data transfers, account lifecycles, and should collaborate with them on how to setup secure permissions.  Ideally you have a dedicated security team dedicated to auditing and creating policies here.   Now, what about other SIS vendors?  So, there are hundreds of SIS vendors and I wish I could tell you one is the “golden” solution, but they all have their own unique troubles.   PowerSchool, Skyward, Ascender, and Infinite Campus are the big dogs here, but like I said there are a ton of smaller companies that may have their benefits.   Veracross is one of those smaller companies and in my experience is larger overseas, but is strategically targeting smaller schools stateside. They are in the middle of upgrading their connection standards and it’s presenting some minor challenges and vendors adapt. I don’t have any first hand experience with them however to speak on their user experience but I have heard some mixed opinions about it. (Though I’ve never heard someone not complain about their SIS to be fair)     Now to your total audit, I’m sure there is someone who’s willing to take your money, but I’ll go ahead and tell you what they will do.  They will likely do some network auditing to find what servers and services you are using, and then they will go to everyone and every department to ask what they are using and why, then generate reports after potentially having conversations with the vendors.  Meanwhile they will likely reach resistance from the locals because it’s scary to have a contractor asking you questions about your job responsibilities.  Maybe you’ll need an external party for this afterall, but it’s very expensive. And if you can find the time, you and everyone else will find a lot of value in you doing this sort of audit to understand your clientele better and have resources at hand for when they need help.    You’re doing a great job here in trying to gather information to make improvements, but I wouldn’t jump into anything here too hastily as it’s only a recipe for more stress. Do your homework and have a plan of action that you can invite others to collaborate with.   As far as data retention, a traditional SIS is by design going to keep historical records, it’s very commonly needed for state reporting and is kind of a core tenant of the software.","I’m sure others have already started this but start with your state PS user group for help. PS hadn’t been helpful at all , in fact, our legal advisor believes they are intentionally stone walling to avoid further liability.   If you don’t have a good state group, look up Marcia Brenner Associates(MBA). They’re not cheap but their training is typically very good. They’re primarily sale plugins for PS but they also have a robust training network.   Past experience, if the “higher ups” are looking for someone to blame it’s because they screwed up and don’t want to be left holding the bag. Do you report to a director or assistant superintendent? They should have caught that no one was involved in data security. I have a PS admin that works for me but she’s not responsible for data security. She’s responsible for making sure our data is accurate and that state and federal reports are done correctly and delivered on time.","For a better source of PS info, I'd check out the PowerSchool User Group (PSUG). I believe there's regional groups, and even without meeting physically they have group.io message boards you can join. It's full of people that ACTUALLY use PS, I've found they're way more helpful than reaching out to PS for 95% of topics.","We have PS self-hosted and were part of the breach as well (it had nothing to do with where it was hosted). We have a department of people who manage the student information systems. The IT department is responsible for the server hardware, firewall rules, and system/app updates.  The delineation is like most of our systems. We manage the physical system, another department manages the application.  Now the SIS department is supervised by the IT director but they essentially operate as two separate departments.","Thanks for your input!  Does your IT Department handle student enrollment as well as adding staff to PS?     I'm jumping back into the PSUG (was mover a decade since I last did)  How is your IT Department handling data retention, auditing, and permission auditing in PS?  Sounds like you enter medical data too - how is that handled (after a student leaves)?  >Every SIS is terrible. lol. They all have their issues.   Oh, 100%. This I know.  I'm not looking to kneejerk switch assuming the grass is greener elsewhere.  But I'd be open to a move with a more security-focused platform (which isn't an easy thing to sort out, given how much time and effort Powerschool themselves spends on supposed security, security measures, security initiatives, security audits ,etc)",Thanks. That's definitely the plan.,"This\^\^  10,000% This\^\^  >IT should be responsible for the systems (maintaining, security etc), but users/depts should be responsible for the data (creating, verifying, removing etc).

I use it all the time ""Admin does not have all the power, we just give the power to the people that do.""  Man... at a former employer, they had an enormous IT infrastructure for their size when I started, like their ***server*** to ***employee*** ratio was roughly \~30%  Decades of accumulated files (NonProfit, ran for many years on volunteer level pay for IT help, not real IT support)  3.5tb of shared file data, mapped drives all over it over time causing long path issues trying to clean up, folder named things like ""Delete after <some date 10y ago>"" still in daily use, 20+ different types of scanners used over time, thousands of single page documents scanned to PDF at 10+ MB per because they were scanned photo quality, thousands of dumped pic/vids shot at insane resolution on years of evolving smart phones, copies of copies of copies.. Unlimited personal use essentially, sensitive data from company to employe information (scans of peoples passports/dl, their mortgage applications, divorce cases, some of those pics and vids dumped form phones were um interesting?)  etc  .... you get it...  Took a few years because it was like changing a tablecloth without disturbing the diners. A few years later I had compressed their 4 virtual hosts into half of one for production, and a second for offsite replication/DR. Merged years old snapshots, hole-punched, and shrank the vm server footprint by about 8tb. Increased their backup retention by years, and got that shared file system down to \~700m  I preached statement that above for a LONG time, that users were the subject matter experts, no one in IT could possibly know what it all was, what to do with it, relevance, IT should not really even have access to some of it to eval!  Nope, it was an IT problem, no one else ""had time to deal with technical stuff""  Eventually just started a mirrored file system of all documents/directories changed in the last 365 days, archived the rest and said ""if you find you are missing something we will restore it. Those fires went out in the first few weeks, then compressed all the media / files, (pics, pdf, converted all vid to h265 mp4, etc) But it literally took years of winning small battles to get it done, by ""IT""","Curious how you/your school differentiates this approach with Powerschool vs. every other department's platform(s).  In other words, it sounds like the proposed solution is ""become  the resident expert in the platform and take control of it"".  Does that also apply to the accounting department software? To facilities software? To food service? To marketing? To HR? To Family services? Each/any one of those like contains PII and someone currently playing ""caretaker"" with no effort to coordinate or view anything from a security perspective.   I get it, but I'm not excited about the idea of approaching it from an arbitrary and  inconsistent approach to deciding what IT *should* be in charge of and what not.","Appreciate the reply!  >Now, that being said IT absolutely should be involved in setting up procedure for secure data transfers, account lifecycles, and should collaborate with them on how to setup secure permissions.  >Ideally you have a dedicated security team dedicated to auditing and creating policies here.  The last point is going is going to be a problem with 95% of smaller schools/districts.  There simply *isn't* a dedicated anything - especially security team.  Everyone wears many hats.  Hence the school secretary (now known as Administrative Assistance) being put in charge of Powerschool in the first place.    I totally get IT *needing* to be involved for certain aspects.  And perhaps I'm just venting here - but that's where the cracks start to show.  To really set a secure tenant up, it would involve having a bit more in depth understanding of the underlaying technology, platform and how it all works in our environment.  And with something as potentially clunky and complex as Powerschool, that's no small task.  But it also sets a different precedence : If that's the expectation (IT will design, configure, implement, enforce, and audit data security for any and all software platforms, then we'd also be on the hook for doing that for every other department.  And I don't think it's realistic or practical to think I'm going to become a security expert in our accounting platform, food service platform, facilities platform, educational platforms, marketing platforms, and so on.  And we're right back to ""have a dedicated pro""... At best, I can make a case for a new hire position...    But I also appreciate it's not likely realistic to expect the primary users of any of those platforms to also become security experts for their respective platforms either.  And so here we are.  >So, there are hundreds of SIS vendors and I wish I could tell you one is the “golden” solution, but they all have their own unique troubles.

Oh, yeah. For sure a consideration - we're certainly legally required to retain *certain* records for a certain period of time.  But in this case, our SiS isn't one of them (for staff).  And the data we do need for students is significantly less than the data we actively hold on to.  HR software will do the staff/hire legal retention. Enrollment and whatever else is needed for students is yet another data bucket to save.  But the rest should be kept to a bare minimum (lest it's all leaked when a vendor is breached...)

Even if the school has an IT director who understands cybersecurity, they typically chafe against bringing in someone who might point out what they could do better.  Most of the time admin and boards don't really care or don't know - they think Security is part of IT's job, but in more mature industries its recognized as separate because its a conflict of interest to put them together. Half the time admin/board have trouble even using technology effectively, so don't expect your ask for a new hire to be fulfilled :)  Hopefully one day the powers-that-be realize that Education should be a regulated industry when it comes to data security just like Healthcare or Finance.  >And therein lies the issue.

Your GWS/M365 admin console should be able to show you which 3rd party apps are being used with your cloud accounts. Data given to third-party vendors is a problem, and should be considered prior to signing up with them. Take a look at their data retention or privacy policy.

School districts and ed-tech partners have all had the chance to revisit their cybersecurity plans over the last few weeks, and this has afforded us the opportunity to rethink some common practices in K-12 technology. Here's our top 10 --> [https://k12techpro.com/top-10-things-to-change-in-k-12/](https://k12techpro.com/top-10-things-to-change-in-k-12/)","Interesting that there isn't anything in the top 10 related to vendor management policies and processes, such as vetting them to get assurances of minimum required data security controls being in place.","I agree with almost everything on that list.  Getting rid of Active Directory I would see as a long term goal.   It has to go, but I think I would rank that as the last thing on that list, not number four; MFA, local admin accounts, and shared accounts are far more important security issues that need to be addressed ASAP.  I would also like number 8 to be expanded to ""staff/teachers not using there district issued computer as their personal device"".   The amount of times I have seen high ranking staff members use their district issued device for their personal side businesses is appalling; using a district device to do the books for your small company or side job is so unethical, and asking me to back up that data or recover it because you didn't make a backup is a hell no.",Wait til the Supreme Court upholds the fifth circuit district’s court decision to eliminate the universal service fee.our networks will get real expensive really quick.,"Our district has implemented just about everything on this list except for getting rid of AD, and MFA for students (what kind of MFA do we expect a 6 year old to use?)","Numbers 1-10 figure out a way to break the chain so vendors actually need to be where they are not based on who they whined and dined and which palms they greased in the various departments of ed but by actually being a quality product.  And not just on the instructional side but actually have something that is actually technologically sound as well. The vast majority of things we (and I am talking specifically my school district in my state) we are soft forced to use because they are one just a few options ""approved"" by the powers that be, and you guessed it it's a choice between a turd, pike of crap, and straight poop.  Until this cycle can be broken, nothing else really matters.",Getting rid of AD would require getting rid of Windows... Good luck with that...,Has anyone implemented 2Fa at the student level?,That article is thrown together. Kind of a joke honestly.,This is something that needs changing. There needs to be an equivalent to PCI for educational tech vendors.,Drool samples?,"No. I think it's overkill. Monitoring access and blocking emails for confirming/activating account signups has been enough.  The more complexity between kids and their destination, the more time we take away from their learning. That certainly has to be weighed carefully, and perhaps others see the need.

33,2025-01-23 09:39:31,Question to those dealing with the PowerSchool Data breach,mjh2901,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1i87jzh/,"Before this goes any further, we are not a powerschool shop and my heart goes out to everyone dealing with this. I am looking at our processess for handling a data breach, and am wondering.  Are any of you tracking the cost of dealing with this breach?  For my district we would be probably around 5 or 6 grand in attorney time vetting the notifications and advising admin/board.  We have about 6000 students but if this was a Campus breach it would include graduates going back about 10 years so we would be notifying in the range of 30,000 people via mail, the estimate for that is about $2 per letter including employee time and a good couple grand in database employee time getting the exports and excel files ready for the mail merges.  What I am getting at is this type of breach the vendor is completely at fault and cost the district close to a 100 grand, which exceeds the yearly hosting/licensing costs for the SIS system.  I am guessing the math is similar for other districts and just scales based on size.  I am going to ignore all the class action lawsuit stuff and go straight to is anyone approaching power school, or considering approaching a vendor that does this with a request for the direct costs?  As a group should we be talking about our future vendor contracts and cost shifting language should a databreach cost the district, and the fault lies completely with the vendor?  I am trying to look at this from how do we learn from this in how we deal with vendors that store student data.","This has sparked ongoing meetings for my manager, director, and myself for the foreseeable future.  Legal team is involved.  Superintendent & our Associate Superintendent is involved. Communications team is involved. Finance manager is involved as he has been worried about AtrieveSRB since he started 5 years ago.  We also now are starting to look at every vendor/3rd party we use for security issues, this is probably going to take the rest of the school year to iron out; BMS systems, boiler systems, lighting, PA systems, clocks... Basically if it connects to the network we have to give it a full audit.  This all should have been done in the first place decades ago.  Cost is not going to be measurable.  The effect is going to be finally, maybe, primary (K-12) might start taking security more seriously as a primary IT department function, instead of putting it off due to cost, political push back from teachers/staff, or historical operational practices.","This is something that's always irked me about the laws in this country (and others maybe?): PowerSchool fucks up and leaks our students' data, but legally *we* are the ones on the hook for notification and the costs associated with that, while the vendor just walks away unscathed.  Now in this case PowerSchool is stepping up, though for our District the breached data doesn't reach the threshold under our state's laws to require notification, so it's moot either way for us. But it wasn't all that long ago that other vendors were breached and we did have to notify, and it was all on us - only thing we got from the vendor was the data that was stolen and a ""we're sorry but you can totally trust us in the future""","I understand your stance, but that’s why we have legal departments and cyber insurance. Sadly, but realistically, this is the cost of doing business.","Excellent questions.    In this case PowerSchool is agreeing to cover all notifications both to staff/students as well as state Attorney General's where necessary.  They are also offering 2 years of credit monitoring/identity theft protection to every person who had information exposed regardless of whether a SS# was attached or not.    But, we are concerned that their response time may not meet the requirement for our states reporting guidelines so we are handling that piece with an outside firm.    I do think going forward that having language in a contract regarding covering costs or having the company handle notifications within the legally required timeframe for your state/locality would be a reasonable ask.  For today, we are working with a firm handling this issue for several clients and they will approach PowerSchool to cover the costs for this.  Its not impossible that they will not be able to recoup the costs, but I believe that a firm representing multiple victims will have a better chance then a single small to medium size district will.","Remember that it was every student on your server ever. It's not only your entire campus, but any student who has ever been on your campus.","My state's laws didn't require us to do any notification because the information we keep in Powerschool is pretty minimal, so we were lucky.","One way to learn is start questioning all your vendors directly now while the PowerSchool incident is fresh in their minds.  I have sent messages to any vendor that has student names and DOB.  I will say some of the responses have been eye opening and has led to some vendors changing their security practices for either our tenant / site or changing their security for all of their customers.    Feel free to use what I have sent or punch it up to fit your needs.    In light of the PowerSchool cybersecurity incident, I would like to know what steps “Vendor Name” has taken to secure support accounts that have access to ""District Name"" “Vendor Name” tenant / site.  For example, please provide information such as the support portal is secured behind a VPN, and the support account logins are secured with an MFA / 2FA solution.","This is why we have cyber security insurance.  If the costs get to be past what we're comfortable just paying out of pocket, then we go to the insurance.   So far, our costs aren't expected to exceed what our deductible for said insurance would be.  We're a small, private school.  There's certainly a lot of new talk about contracts and obligations, to go with the already existing talk about such things.  And it's all good and important.  But at the end of the day - there's not always a lot of choices.  And when there are choices, it's not always up to the people who you'd prefer.  And when it is up to certain people, security isn't always at the top of their list.  This is how it's always been.  And incidents like there *hopefully* move the needle a bit on that.  As a small, independent school - we're pretty much at the mercy of vendors and hopefully that larger districts (with more pull...) band together to force change for everyone.  Let's face it, no vendor is going to just willingly accept more risk/accountability than they are forced to.   For us, more of ""what we learn"" is about knowing what information we actually ARE storing/giving and who/when/where it is.    Fun fact - There are records you cannot DELETE in Powerschool.  So while you ""own"" the data, you don't really have full control over it.  The workaround seems to be to just ""overwrite"" it with false data.  And to the best of my knowledge, there's no tools built-in or available 3rd party to do such thing in a controlled, scheduled, audited, automated, and managed way.  I suspect that's not fully unique to Powerschool (I'm not database engineer....) but I do feel the lack of plain disclosure of that and that lack of ways to address it are problematic.","I disagree that Powerschool is 'stepping up'. They are, like any company in this position, working in lockstep with their legal team and doing the minimum necessary to limit legal exposure.  Let's not forget the circumstances around the breach were due to their internal security processes being woefully below the bare minumum, which is why they are going to get sued to oblivion, and rightfully so. I haven't been able to chase down my client's PS rep as yet to get answers to some pointed questions about improvement to those internal processes. I'm guessing because the rep has been told to be quiet.","For the vendor that did not step up, maybe there should be a board policy that bars the school from re-upping with any vendor that causes a data breach and then fails to pay for the incidental costs.  That way, admin can’t just at a whim overrule IT when they go to end the contract.","I am looking at our state’s notification rules (California). So far, my research has shown that our notification timeline starts when we become aware and is not tied to the time of the breach, but it’s very fuzzy as to whether or not the clock starts when the vendor finds out or if it is when the vendor notifies us.  An argument could be made that the vendor is the school district as far as the notification timeline is concerned.",Don't forget to ask about Data Protection Agreements and Data Retention policies.,I've been thinking about spinning up something to archive the historical data in a controlled way. I can envision a way where this becomes a service available to anyone.,Look up PowerSchool DDA if you want to over write data in mass.,"I was aghast when i found out (before this incident) that data could not be pruned in PowerSchool. Most enterprise databases allow pruning. Oracle DB, which Powerschool uses, has pruning capability.  This also mean that if you were hosted locally, you had to keep upgrading your storage because you couldn't delete anything.  You should also be aware that Cyberinsurance doesn't always cover everything. You need to check the clauses carefully.","I agree they're not doing as much as they could, but they are also doing more than the minimum required, such as taking on the costs of notifications themselves, which as I mentioned is stupidly on us and not on them. They could absolutely do what every other vendor does and just wash their hands, then wait for the class action lawsuit to settle with only those customers who bother to sign on","This would require the Board to give a shit. To them, it's just why we have insurance","It is when you become aware. If a district became aware of the breach before the vendor (due to logging, etc) that is when the timeline would start.",PowerSchool is working on this after years of us asking for it. Put a ticket in if you want to start convo with them on mass data deletion imo.,"This is why these things happen. Because the Board doesn't really care. If they did, they would be asking to be updated on the results of security reviews every quarter/half-year/year. How many school boards do that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

37,2025-01-19 11:41:14,How you do find the money for repairs? Technology Fees/Safety Deposits? Warranties? Hard-shells? Billing parents? All of the above?,rjp94sep,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1i55j0j/,"Sorry for the novel, but I am lost at what to do.  CONTEXT:  Stateside. Minnesota. Over 90% of those students qualify for free-reduced lunch. Urban/city. 500 in person students 300 and growing online/hybrid students (enrollment will close in March supposedly). I am a Theater major turned one-person IT Department for a public K-8 Charter. Was working in the school as a paraprofessional two years ago when they noticed I was good with computers and asked if I waned to help the IT Manager who was drowning. Did helpdesk/Tier 1 stuff for about 6 months, and when they fired the IT Manager (still don't know why), they offered me the job.   In person kids: Chromebooks  are *supposed* to live in the carts. Teachers/students have a bad habit of putting them in desks overnight/weekend. We supply headphones. \~500  Online: we have \~40-50 and growing kids 100% online from their homes. Devices, headphones, 45W Charger brick.   Hybrid: \~300 kids spread across 1 of 6 community centers we partner with and a staff member ""manages"" the online-kids in person while an online teacher does instruction. Then the in person staff member helps facilitate breaks/lunch/recess/parent pickup and drop off. I was ALSO just told last week most of our hybrid kids bring the Chromebooks home with them over the weekend and they just rip chargers out of the carts; therefore getting a spike in missing headphones/devices/chargers for carts that were pre-strung.   No hard shell/softshell cases on any of them. No software tracking them/managing them outside of Google Admin and spreadsheets. Half the Chromebook fleet was purchased/donated by the local prison back in 2019/2020. Other half just purchased in the last year thanks to me, has a 3-year warranty with the MSP we bought them from. (If you have any good 'buy-back' vendors in the Midwest, please drop their name).   Previous IT Manager just put the broken headphones and Chromebooks in a pile in the corner to ""take care of in the summer.""  No documenting. No asset tagging. No numbering.  Not even color coding. If a teacher/staff was in need of a replacement and he didn't have it, he'd just go out and buy a batch of 5-10 devices from either Best Buy or a get a quote from the local owned MSP we use who is robbing this school blind--No Edu discount-whole sale cost for the device, whole sale license,  plus $93 install/ set up fee PER device, and $100 three year warranty. None of the IT Department budget was/is subdivided, just all out of the ""one bucket budget."" As far as I can tell, he got help for E-rates for Network/Cybersecurity/paying the MSP, but no help for device repairs from any grants/vendors/local colleges/ local repair shops, and no Technology Fee for staff and/or students.     So my question is, is it normal to ask parents/guardians to pay a technology fee? The tate of MN doesn't allow ""enrollment fees"" but they do allow Safety Deposits and in the event the student destroys/loses ""educational materials"" that money is then used.   I had he kids and parents sign a LCA's back in August that says 'I agree to pay if my kid breaks something,' so why aren't we collecting? Do I have to be the one to reach out to the parents/guardians?   I want to go to the school board and propose starting next year do we ask for a $30 security deposit per kid if they are in person and $50 for the online/hybrid students. If your kid breaks it, it comes out of that fee and if  they didn't break anything all year long, you can either get the money back for 3 months or have it roll over to the next school year until something happens.  Again, am I crazy to ask this? Is this too much work? Should I just be using my time more wisely applying for grants? I feel like the only way kids/parents are going to respect the school and its materials is if they are held liable for paying for them if/when their kid does something outside of ""Accidental."" But I'd say with a 28% breakage rate for headphones and 30% breakage rate from Chromebooks, only 10% of each of those are accidents.   What billing/software do you use? I am begging them to get me something like Incident IQ for next year so it can generate bills straight to PowerSchool (while also being an asset management for me and tech ticket forum). Any better ideas/ experience telling you I should look at another company? Right now I'm just using spreadsheets and updating them what feels like every other minute. I know there are billing tools inside PowerSchool, are any of them free? Preference? Annual cost?  I have a meeting with CFO in a few weeks to explain why every months she's getting invoices for $1k-$2k from repair shops and CDW-G for more headphones. I have the data. I have the numbers.  I just don't know which road do go down? Do we start asking for safety deposits? Do we get a grant to put hard shell cases on computers and hope that is enough? Do we reach out to a 3rd party that does warranties AND repairs that don't cost us an arm and a leg? A part of me wants to propose all of them, but I'm afraid it will be too much to swallow in one meeting.   Please, if you have any help/guidance, I'd gladly take it. These kids deserve good tech, but I can't make something out of nothing if all the money is evaporating around me in keyed/scratched lids with profanity on it, caved in LCD screens and missing keyboard tiles.","I'm going to make this short.  As far as the collecting of fees from parents and guardians, that is not your responsibility.  You are the de facto Technology Director, and that is not your purview.  It's not your responsibility to enforce any agreements that parents and students have with the school.    If the school says it's on your shoulders to charge and collect fees for chromebooks and the damage to them, you need to find a new job ASAP.     Also, sidenote.  As far as powerschool goes, you probably ought to have parents and students freeze their credit, but that's another story.","As far as funding repairs, we pay for the longest warranty we can get up front. In our case, that's Applecare+ for Schools. Where we can, we opt for no service fees. That said, between iPads and MacBooks, we probably average 2 to 3 broken devices per month (around 2000 students). Cases never saved us on MacBooks, but I won't buy iPads without then.   I've been told anything purchased with Federal funds we can't charge any fees for, and something like half of my fleet is bought that way, so my Superintendent says she doesn't want to charge for some devices and not others. I'm on board with that.  For assets, we're about to move to OnetoOne Plus from Excel spreadsheets. Cheaper than Incident IQ and accomplishes the same goals.  With peripherals (specifically headphones), I just accept some ""walk away."" It sucks, but I don't have the time, nor energy, to fight with the schools about. I recommend to the schools that they use some of their technology monies to purchase cheap headphones in bulk. We did buy some ""nicer"" headphones 2 years ago that cost more. The schools take those up when they aren't being used for testing.  Keep the data and use it for your meeting. Regardless what several CFOs think (mine included), IT isn't a one and done purchase. We always need bits and pieces and it's a running expense. One thing I've had success with is keeping my CFO looped in. When he knows that things are happening and he can start shifting funds around, he's much happier to help.",Hard cases fix one issue (drop damage) in exchange for (hinge damaged) much rather deal with drop damage then hinge damage any day. My other suggestion is buy what you need for Chromebooks with a 10% overage to use for parts and order extra screens.,"An official help desk/ticketing system + an asset management system is a must. Ours our separate (due to cost restrictions), but regardless it’s required to track 1) when a device is broken 2) what is was replaced with 3) status of repairs/warranty 4) when fees were assessed and 5) know exactly how many spares/broken/checked out/etc you have.   We have a status in our ticketing system that our L1 tech puts the ticket on waiting for the fee’s to be assessed by L2 in our SIS. Our student handbook clearly outlines our fee schedule. We’re a small school so we handle it “internally”, but agree that it should go to the main/business office for fee assessment if you are a bigger school.   We also offer insurance through Securranty - free to the school and completely optional for the parents. Our adoption rate has increased year over year.",Having read your post my feeling is you are in way over your head I would get a new job.  This school is run like a shit show.   I mean unless you have the funding knowledge and admin support to more or less shut it all down and build it right.  I work in a k-6 public school with a 2 man IT department with non of the issues you have. I would leave if we did.,"Get a warranty with ADP coverage from an OEM and be sure it includes onsite support, not depot.  All third party warranties suck, turn around time sucks, and it's a headache to manage. See if you can get a relationship with an MSP in the area that will come out once a week and repair them. If you want to be 1-1 this is the cost if doing business.  If you are serving a disadvantaged population it is extremely difficult for them to pay a $50 deposit.  They have paid taxes, they should incur cost for a device that's instrumental to their children's education.  We charge nominal fees for intentional damage, add it to their SIS account, never seek enforcement of payment.  I do not care if they pay it, I'm not a debt collector.  Some pay, and we waive most.  We rarely have to get more devices or have to pay anything else minus our yearly refresh of devices.  Your CFO wot like the upfront cost, but the ROI comes in with no surprises 2k invoices, and you have more time to focus on other tasks.  Don't forget to calculate how much time you are spending on repairs to the overall cost, your time isn't free.","Accidental damage is repaired free of charge.   However, we treat carelessness and abuse with the ‘you break it, you buy it’ method. The cost is reported to the parents and the amount is added to the students account.   We are 1-1 from grade 3 to 8 with Chromebooks, so costs aren’t bad.  9 through 12 are 1-1 with MacBook Airs. A few careless students have learned the hard way a broken screen on a Chromebook is cheap. A broken screen on a MacBook Air is not.","You are in a major disaster.  1. Buyback places? You live in the same state with the one we use. [Chromebookparts.com](http://Chromebookparts.com) in st. Paul. They also sell parts cheaper than you will get locally. Many repairs you can easily do yourself. They also do repairs.  2. Am I seeing this that you have no CIPA compliant web filter? Is a charter school required to? I know our school MUST have a CIPA compliant web filter.     3. On your $30 fee. Try to make it yearly and non-refundable. I can't imagine the fun in tracking who has to be paid back. Ours is an ""activity fund"" This will give you funding to buy parts in bulk. We give a 50% discount on first time breaks with that and the cost of repairs is linked to their school lunch discount. This should not be something you have to be involved with.  4. Start relationships with vendors so you can get the best pricing. CDW, Chromebookparts, CTL, Dell, Howard technologies, etc. Having multiple vendors compete for your business will get you discounts you wouldn't necessarily otherwise see from a local supplier.  5. For 1:1 devices students take home I would recommend a neoprene sleeve which is highly water resistant. They will protect the chromebook about as cheaply as possible. Example: [https://a.co/d/1kw4sW2](https://a.co/d/1kw4sW2)  6. IncidentIq is a wise choice. They do have a Chromebook piece that will pull your inventory direct from Google Workspace.",The first repair is free. We chage parts cost for the rest. I send the info up to the office and they apply it to the student fee.,"we try to sell warranty repair system where parents paid x amount of dollars per year, but when it came time to pay, only the parents that could afford it signed up for the warranty, and it ended up just being a mess trying to track deductibles.  it ended up costing us more to manage our repair system and Chase down payments then it ended up costing to just get a full accidental damage warranty.   the truth is that technology, especially a one-to-one program, takes money to maintain. total cost of ownership is important in a one-to-one program not just the cost of the device.   I've stuck with the district I work in for over 20 years because they understand that there are more costs to technology above and beyond the purchase price of the equipment.   if the district isn't willing to put in some money towards the maintenance of the program, then it's not worth even doing in the first place.","There's a fee at my local school for lost chargers, lost laptops, and broken screens. I work at a completely different school that's BYOD and am thankful for that every day. My kids know how to take care of tech, and seeing how their computers start looking after a while, I can't imagine the kids that just don't care.",My district is somewhat in the same boat we don't really collect much on the insurance unfortunately for broken Chromebook we got stacks of them and nothing to show for... its like pulling teeth to get any money for damage property we just take what we can salvage and move on.,"Now BYOD, so they are on their own, but, when we had iPads, we had them fully insured and gave them out with a mil spec rubber case from UZBLE… but still charged a $50 deductible per incident, as a deterrent, which really worked well. This was years ago, but I would do it the same way if I had to start over.   What I would change is the way we kept tabs on devices, repairs and deductibles. We did it with Google sheets then, but now I would use our inventory system (Snipe-IT) and/or something like ITFlow, which is a more complete management system geared towards MSPs and has billing capabilities on top of contract tracking, some documentation, etc.  By the way, these last two I have them selfhosted on a 10+ year old PC running Proxmox, with another PC running Proxmox backup Server. In plain English, this setup is FFFRRREEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!  Hope this helps.","Before I read all of that, what percent of total budget is IT? All in, including salaries.","We use Chromebooks. I wish our average was 2-3 per month. It's more like 2-3 per day. 😂  We currently don't have a fee policy, but I was able to secure ADP for three years with parts ordering for in house repairs. That runs out soon. Not sure what the board is going to do.   I have heard of places offering ""insurance"" coverage that parents can purchase. It might be something to look into.   Keeping track of assets is important. All of ours have simple barcode tags and that information is loaded into Google admin. Less than ideal, but it works.  Edit: It sounds like they had reasons for putting you into that position and getting rid of the other person. It also sounds like they didn't share that info with you. It could be coincidence, but my guess is that the two things are related. This is something that sparks my curiosity, only because I'm curious that way. Water under the bridge.  It's your position and your problems to deal with now.","So then you report the cost to the parents and then what? I'm sure I could bill them, but its the collecting part that I'm getting push back from Leadership about rn. They don't think its worth the trouble and politics if only 1/10 parents are actually going to pay.","I'm talking with CBParts, thank you. So far they are the only one I know of.   We do have a CIPA filter, Securely. Eh, it works, but still doesn't block YouTube half the time.  See, that sounds great, but from my understanding, and I could be wrong, but my state law makes it seem like I can't do fees. Minnesota Statues 123B.35-40. You can do fees for damages but that's it? Idk I'm not a lawyer. I don't know this legal jargon.  [https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/2015/cite/123B.35](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/2015/cite/123B.35)  4. That's what I've spent the last few months doing and plan to keep doing, but its hard for me to know who is legit and who is not cuz they ""claim"" to have worked with the previous guy and I have no documentation to say if they did or not.  5. Thank you, this looks great. Do you know if they sell these in bulk directly from the company?  6. Thank you for the validation...With Google Workspace, we have Google EDU Fundementals and I'm curious if you have any strong opinoins on the pros vs cons of upgrading to Standard/ Edu Plus? I know a lot of IT Admin stuff is behind the paywall but I'm not sure if its worth it for us right now with the budget and the small scale of our school?","See, that's the thing, I don't know. I've asked and they won't tell me. They say a budget is a ""living number"" and its unreliable year after year so they can't make me any firm promises. The closest thing I came to see what I was cleaning up the A/V cart TV from a School board meeting and the percentage of the budget was dedicated to IT but it was 15% overall and apparently last year as a Tier 1/Helpdesk, I ""overspent"" by asking for extra chargers and headphones.","In our district, students don't graduate if they have a balance on their account.   Well, technically, they do graduate, but they aren't allowed to take part in any graduation activities. And, if their account is over a certain amount, they are prevented from participating in extra curicular activities, including sports and things like prom and field trips.   But, the main way we enforce payment is, say a high school student breaks their MacBook Air screen. It gets replaced, and then the bill is added to the account. Most times, it gets paid. Sometimes it doesn't. And when said student breaks another screen, they get an old Chromebook to use, since they obviously can't take care of a decent laptop.   If a family is not rolling in dough, (which most of our families aren't), payment arrangements can be made. And we don't charge for labor for repairs, or mark up parts at all. All the parents/students pay for is what it cost us for the replacement part.","I don't try to figure out the legalities myself. I reach out to admin. Our encumbrance clerk is very knowledgeable and if we had a legal staff I would reach out to them as well.  2. We are currently using Lightspeed but I recently had a meeting with Hapara and we will likely be switching to them. As a web filter, classroom management and alerting system they seem to hand more control to the teachers.  4. I had that a lot as well. If they claimed to have worked with the previous guy I am lucky enough to be able to ask him. That said I pretty much started from scratch and I do not have many vendors. I did miss [Microcenter.com](http://Microcenter.com) on my list as well.    5. The link on amazon has a ""request quote for 999+""  We have also used [Custom Branded Laptop, Tablet & Phone Cases, Covers & Sleeves | Custom Logo Cases](https://www.customlogocases.com/) when buying in big enough bulk so we could have the school logo on it. These are more or less identical to the ones on amazon.  6. we are still on fundamentals as well. Should I ever move staff to Chromebooks I will see about getting just them upgraded. Yes a lot of tools for us are behind that paywall but I have been able to do without it for now.    Something else we did here because we are a small staff is get the MSP software ""NinjaOne"" which allows me to have Teamviewer as an addon (cheaper than direct) and our AV is installed via NinjaOne as well. It also give me remote access to the registry, automations and more. It is a very useful tool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,2025-01-18 14:02:40,PowerSchool - Internal security concerns,NorthernVenomFang,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1i4hbrr/,"So it looks like Powerschool may have a second compromised account, this time a subcontractors developer account that was compromised by malware, according to an article by TechCrunch on friday...  https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/malware-stole-internal-powerschool-passwords-from-engineers-hacked-computer/  Anyone else having doubts about Powerschool's internal security processes, especially around contractors/subcontractors?","They used java all the way up until 2021.... They have always been shit. But that explains 90 percent of the services for education.  This whole debacle did not surprise me at all, and I legitimately believe this could have been any major educational vendor/service that got hit not just power school.",Class action suit when? These districts should soak Powerschool and Bane Capital for as much as they can get,"Perhaps they didn’t implement MFA before the incident because their approach to deploying SSO—like with their SIS—was overly complicated, haha.  On a separate note, someone mentioned that they asked PowerSchool support how they could assist remotely if maintenance mode and remote support are disabled. PowerSchool indicated they still have access and can execute scripts directly against the database. So, is there truly a way to ensure this doesn’t happen again, I doubt it.","I agree it could occur to any vendor (K12 or otherwise), but PowerSchool SIS had it coming for sure. They have decades of legacy code. PowerSource was ""killed off"" years ago and replaced by ""PowerSchool Community"", but much of the useful content is still on PowerSource... So they get to maintain two systems forever.  Whatever ""maintain"" actually means at PowerSchool.  The SIS product cannot be fixed - truly. It is not fixable. The only option would be a 100% re-write, but that would alienate all customers to the point they might as well migrate to another vendor. So they keep writing little patches here and there. We get some new features from time to time. It's usually whatever marketing believes is important so they can sell the company again. [In 2015, I remember they developed PowerSchool for Apple Watch](https://www.powerschool.com/news/powerschool-mobile-now-available-apple-watch/). This was the icing on the cake, because there were major things lacking in the product, but Marketing probably decided this sounded more exciting. Did any customer actually use this? Probably not... Now I'm sure the current owners will focus on ""AI"" and then sell PowerSchool SIS again. Just wait for it...  Customers have been allowed to, and have needed to heavily modify their SIS instances to make the product work for them. (Custom fields, pages, plugins, etc). This is mostly PowerSchool's own fault for not being responsive to build the product that we need. Things that should be baked in, like online registration, have instead been an acquisition / integration trainwreck that came decades too late.  PowerSchool spent years of not being responsive to customer feedback, so everyone went wild tweaking PowerSchool to fit their needs, bolting on and endless array of 3rd party apps. Now, for PowerSchool to make improvements, they have to break a lot of those user customizations that we were forced to make.  The database structure is a disaster with legacy design dating back to when Apple owned PowerSchool.  PowerSchool has had too many owners and developers over the decades. Now we're in the phase of private equity vulchers like Vista Equity Partners, Onex Partners, and Bain Capital buying and selling PowerSchool. We all know what is going on... Buy it, find a way to sell it for slightly more, wash your hands of it, on to the next fool to deal with it.  All that being said, where are we all going to go? Infinite Campus? Do we really want to undertake a SIS migration? We'd just be trading our current problems for different ones, likely adding a lot of frustration to all our users during the transition.","Lawsuits are already started:  https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/powerschool-sued-over-december-breach-of-student-teacher-data   So lawsuits have already started.

They are coming, probably by end of Q1.",Or it is just non-existent... Have you seen PowerSource? It's archaic at best.

39,2025-01-15 06:47:32,I need to ask about Powerschool's response,Square_Pear1784,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1i1xqiw/,"The school stopped using Powerschool for 2024-2025 school year and switched to Infinite Campus. Well, that does not exclude us from the situation since the issue goes back all the way to 2013. Since I am new they did not grant me access (since I never had access to powerschool when the school had it), but the head of school was able to get access and pull the data they told us about.  So they sent an email basically telling us what type of data to look for and how many in each category was compromised. Also, telling us how to view and export that data.  However, then telling us that we don't need to notify any student, parent, or staff of these details. That they would be reaching out themselves to let families and staff know. However, they said they didnt know all the details in the data compromised  My head of school feels that by doing this they have put liability on us to an extent. I can't help but agree. By giving us this info and telling us that they can't be for sure on all info in certain text fields, it puts liability on us. However we don't need to contact the families??  Also, so we are just to believe that the bad actors truly deleted the data and that it isnt out there.  The Head of School and myself can't help but feel stressed, frustrated, and unsure of next steps. The communication from Powerschool feels like ""trust us, the data is gone. But hey here is what was compromised to the exact details. We will be notifying individuals so you dont have to, but we also dont know all the details in the data so be aware and take a look at the data compromised, but yeah its not out there so dont worry.""  Then our already busy admin is bracing for questions they are not sure how to answer.  Sorry for the vent. Am I missing something? How do you all feel about the response so far?  Edit: I found out that we do have a Attorny and are expecting to hear from them today on further guidance. ",Ignore the info about the data was “deleted”.  Treat this as the data is out there….  handle it that way.,"It's easy to throw stones and I try to avoid it because things happen, but PowerSchool's missteps here are appalling.  * Their all-powerful employee accounts weren't secured by MFA, were accessible from anywhere, and apparently had no sort of alerting to warn that one person had logged into hundreds of instances from a foreign country in a short period of time. * They learned about it a week later, then inexplicably didn't tell any of us for **10 more days**.  That's a breach of the contract that they have in place with many districts. * Somehow, in those 10 days, they still didn't have publications ready to go, and didn't have an indication of specific data compromised or even a breakdown explaining how we can dig through logs ourselves.  We had to figure it out.  They can try to say they were working hard on it, but it's extremely clear that it wasn't all hands on deck for them, which is disappointing. * Even after the initial meetings, they still didn't get information out in a timely manner, citing things being hung up in legal.  What did come out is awful and feels like it's starting down a path to backpedaling on some promises (see the suddenly non-committal wording around credit monitoring/identity protection).  It's so frustrating that they seem to be patting themselves on the back for their response here when it feels like it couldn't have been much worse.  They need to see a shake-up of leadership and some significant financial pain from this.","While this is 100% on Powerschool (for the breach itself) - you (your District/school) are responsible for that data.  YOU chose to trust Powerschool.  You put the data there, not your students/teachers/families.  They are going to likely direct their anger/concerns/lawsuits at you, not Powerschool. (Although Powerschool is already dealing with lawsuits from this incident, from a different angle)  So definitely treat it as if this is your problem, not just Powerschool's.  It certainly helps push the blame a bit and hopefully buys some goodwill and understanding from higher-ups (and maybe the general public and other stakeholders).  Powerschool dropped the ball, but we put the ball in Powerschool's hands in the first place.  Like other's are saying here: Because of the nature of this particular incident, it's largely a legal/PR/communications issue at this phase.  Powerschool dealt with the whole IT side of it (detection, analysis, containment, mitigation/eradication, recovery).  Not because they're the best at it or we failed at it - but simply because it's their systems and they're the only ones in a position to do so (at a technical level).  We're all left with the fallout.    So the question becomes about the extent of liability - ours and Powerschool's.  And that may vary by state and contract.  With that, I'd also advise not assuming that whatever is known now is the totality of it (or necessarily the worst of it).  Plan as if there's more bad weather coming from this storm...",This is why you have legal council on retainer,What's the part about going back to 2013?,This is greatly dependent on what state you are in.  Google search data breach <state> laws to find out what your obligation is.  In our state once we have been notfied of a breach than we are still legally obligated to contact families that were affected EVEN IF Powershool also notifies them.,"Strongly recommend reaching out to your cyber security insurance, who will likely get you to a legal dept.   Trust but verify.  If your instance is still online, for data retrieval, then your info was likely part of the exfiltration.  Fields of major concern are medical alerts, ssn, gpa. Other fields are generally considered directory information and may not fall under your state's mandatory notification requirements.  Yes, it is powerschool's incident, but best to get the proper guidance of cyber security and legal team.","I spent 2 days talking with lawyers after we were notified.  Basically what our attorney and the attorney from our cyber insurance said was that we did need to notify to an extent, but we had to be careful in what we said.  We want to appear as transparent as possible, but not say something that oversteps and puts liability on us.  They advised that we avoid the term ""breach"".  I would highly suggest discussing whatever you do with an attorney, I would hope you have cyber insurance.  One of your first calls should have been to your cyber insurance company to make sure they are ready to pick up anywhere that PowerSchool fails.  There is a lot of legal speak in what they are saying about notifications, like they will notify ""in compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations.""  Does your state have regulation that requires them to notify or does it fall on you, if your state doesn't have regulations does your contract state that PowerSchool will be required to make the notifications?  If you answered no to both of those, you may end up being responsible for all notifications.  While we're all hoping that PowerSchool does the right thing, we won't know until they tell us exactly what they are going to do.","Why would you listen to Powerschool about...anything?  Notify those who you have contact info for, make a post on your website or in your newsletter. Not sure why you need a Powerschool instance available on the internet if you aren't using it anymore. Maybe migrate to on-prem and turn tgat server off unless you need it.   PowerSchool promised email templates days ago and ongoing communication and I've gotten crickets.  The lawsuits have already started being filed, and I imagine they're going to shell up.",">They learned about it a week later, then inexplicably didn't tell any of us for 10 more days. That's a breach of the contract that they have in place with many districts.  They should have learned about it in a support ticket which was submitted, alerting them on Dec 27, but only admit learning about it on Dec 28 when the adversary contacted them.  Imagine if the adversary were interested in collecting and using as much data as possible instead of simply extorting a payment.","Your school probably has outside legal counsel on retainer. Engage them now. Like the commenter above noted, PowerSchool won't necessarily be able to account for all of your state's requirements around breach notifications, and your school (and your host school? not sure how you're structured) may have policies that apply. You may or may not have PHI or PII included. Don't count on PS's corporate attorneys or communications people being able to address your specific case.","Good point here. We had begun getting everything ready to send out to the affected members with PowerSchool's scripted response when our insurance told us to stop until told otherwise from them. Apparently, a lot of schools are starting to group together in a class action lawsuit so we shall see.",Powerschool confirmed for us that we were part of the exfiltration. They provided us access back to our Powerschool and gave steps to access data using Data Export Manager. They gave us a spreadsheet detialing what info was targeted and how many files for each. Also which was PII.   Beyond that we are lost. I dont know anything about cyber security insurace for the school. I wouldnt be surposed if we dont have anything like that. We are a public charter school so maybe the state handles part of that. I guess I need to contact someone at the state.,We got an email templete we sent out to parents letting them know the situation. Beyond that nothing else. The head of school sent the email out. Contacting each person impacted individually (1600+) is beyond our compacity.,"You may be in more of a pickle given your charter status than you realize. You DON'T have the full backing of the state or region because the state or region likely just see charter schools a independently run systems without all of the burracracy (all the departments that are actually needed in a large district) including legal.   It would behoove you to speak to your head of school, and if there is a board, they need to be notified of this as well. You must ask them to seek legal consultation for this. Get the legal issues as far away from your hands as you can at this point, and be as transparent as possible.","Start with your school's insurance company.  The same one that is used if a roof leaks, or if a vandalism occurs.  They should be your first call.  Include the school's legal counsel as well.  For me, I reached out due to making sure if our community attempts to file against us, that we have a legal team and the processes in place.  I doubt that anyone would attempt to file against us, but in today's world, you can't just assume.  If you don't have cyber security insurance,  Reach out to CISA for additional guidance. https://www.cisa.gov/","> Contacting each person impacted individually (1600+) is beyond our compacity.  This is a problem. A simple mail merge and bulk email service should be all that is needed for this. What services or systems are in place to notify stakeholders via email in bulk?

Complete negligence and ignoring all industry standards.  This will be settled by a lawsuit. And unfortunately the costs will then be passed on to their customers. I’m sure next year costs will remain flat as a “gesture of goodwill”, then they’ll hit everyone with 10% increases for the next five years to “increase our cybersecurity infrastructure to meet the growing needs of our clients”.   Get out while you can!","I did some research on the weekend and found over 150 school divisions/districts/states/provinces that reported being part of this breach.   That was just using Google and DuckDuckGo.   As to how we got here...  Shoddy security practices;  remote access application for management put behind a public facing website with no 2FA/MFA, plus a remote access support option being turned on by default.   That should have never been publicly accessible, and the remote access should have been set to be on for only 24 - 72hrs that has to be enabled by the client... Not 30 days that they talked about in the webinar...  There commitment to security is appalling.  I watched this video on their YouTube channel from last year and I wanted to hurl:  https://youtu.be/OnPeOHyEGT8?si=ff9vQb87gct_LbkQ  As to where we go from here, tighter contracts when purchasing and better government regulations around security standards for K-12 and higher education student information systems.  Until governments make it a legal requirement this is going to continue to happen.",All districts except on-prem that had their own security controls like dropping foreign IPs at the LAN edge.  Just my guess based on the details of the incident and Powerschool's public communications.,"Couple things:  \- There's been good discussion/FAQ about this on K12TechPro too. Light reminder that K12TechPro is a vetted private community of only k12 techs and not viewable by the public. [https://members.k12techpro.com/](https://members.k12techpro.com/) (If you aren't on there yet, click sponsorship to get in free)  \- K12 SIX also posted a FAQ recently [https://www.k12six.org/news/powerschool-cyber-incident-faq](https://www.k12six.org/news/powerschool-cyber-incident-faq)","I've worked in private industry previously and now as a tech director in K12.  Generally speaking, public education is much more reactive than proactive, as compared to other industries.  They truly tend to wait for something bad to happen before addressing it, and when it comes to cyber security this is completely counter intuitive.   Here in Texas, the state requires disaster annexes/plans.  Fire, flood, hurricane, pipeline explosion, and now, cyber attack incident or attack.  The initial draft they gave us was both confusing and infuriating.  More than half the ""requirements"" would not apply to our district (which they have since removed), but also the language very much treating this kind of an event as a ""when"" this is going to happen, not an ""if.""  Powerschool and their PR team were trying to put themselves in the best position possible considering this absolute disaster, and I sincerely don't blame them for that.  I believe they did not consider security as a foundational point of their product and services as a whole, though now they might.  However, the promise that the stolen data has been deleted is laughable.  Great PR move, unlikely reflected in reality.  Our SIS currently does not even offer MFA, never has.  I've been asking(see: gently bitching to) them about it for years.  I asked them last week because of this powerschool attack and was told due to other issues, there is now no ETA for additional security.  It frustrates me greatly, but is completely out of our control.  We cannot afford a ""better SIS"" and powerschool getting hacked removes any argument that paying more equates to better security.  Really enjoyed the podcast on the PowerSchool breach and learned a lot.  It has spurred me to have talks with my administrators and be more proactive.  I've asked them to sit down and discuss what would happen and how we'd handle this disaster if it happened to us.    ./end-rant",[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLXC6lXQtoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLXC6lXQtoM) \- good panel here on the situation,Lawsuits already started to popup on Friday: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/powerschool-sued-over-december-breach-of-student-teacher-data,"It’s frustrating but not unimaginable in this day and age, unfortunately. I read that 60% of the fortune 100 companies have been in impacted by breaches, so, this incident could happen(d) to any company. I’m not sure any amount of law or agreements would make any more material impact for this situation when nothing can be 100% secure but am not opposed to seeing more strict controls.  Jumping ship is a huge undertaking and would be a knee  jerk reaction with profound disruptions to the entire organization that should not be made hastily. Best to stay in contact with PS and stakeholders  until we see what changes are (or are not) made, then decide.  Silver lining take aways for us are are: review /tighten up governance, review/improve disaster plans and practice scenarios annually.   “It’s not a matter of if, only a matter of when and how bad “ -some wise person",Is there a list of which districts or schools that were breached ?,Pretty sure this is how we avoided it.,Or noticing 1TB of data being sent to Eastern Europe on a Sunday.,"When I was still IT Director for a K-12, we wanted to apply data retention to all our systems. PowerSchool told us that we could not delete any data, including those of students who had left or graduated. Something to do with the integrity of the database.      Our workaround was to just write over the data with 1s and 0s.  But my point is that this is not 'Security by Design'.     I agree with you that Education tends to be reactive rather than proactive when it comes to Cybersec. A large part of it is because Admin doesn't understand and they don't really want to understand - they think its an IT problem. In mature industries, IT and Cyber are different departments for a reason.","Not publicly available.

41,2025-01-10 10:45:21,Sharing Passwords? You're Fired!,K12TechTalkPodcast,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1hya51w/,"Available here... [https://k12techtalkpodcast.com/e/powerschool-password-perils-a-tale-of-tech-troubles/](https://k12techtalkpodcast.com/e/powerschool-password-perils-a-tale-of-tech-troubles/) and all major podcast platforms  The main focus of this episode is the story where a teacher was terminated for allegedly sharing her password, leading to students tampering with electronic records and facing charges. We tackle tough questions about accountability: Should a teacher lose their job for password sharing? Are students facing reasonable repercussions? Who bears the blame in cases of security breaches like this? We discuss the essential measures for cybersecurity in schools, emphasizing the necessity of multi-layered security approaches. [https://www.yahoo.com/news/liverpool-high-school-staff-member-215453485.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/liverpool-high-school-staff-member-215453485.html)  ","MFA covers over a multitude of user carelessness when it comes to security. If MFA had been enforced for this district, none of this could happen unless the teacher also gives the student the MFA access (much less likely)","Should a teacher be fired for breaching security?  In short, yes.  Will they?  Probably not ever.  Network security is something I'm ever trying to improve upon.  There were times, just a few years ago, I was somewhat too relaxed.  I'm going to share a personal story which includes my own admission of faults.  We had a specific SSID for our district owned equipment, students did not have wifi access at all.  We also are very rural and our buildings do not allow any really usable cellular bandwidth.  This SSID only had a WPA2 password, and for ever had only been secured enough that no one knew it but the IT team.  Relying on this would eventually lead to failure due to another security problem I inherited: teacher accounts were local administrators on their laptops.  Long story shortish: a teacher who I believe out of wishing to be popular with students and and who was mad she didn't have the administrator password for her lab computers gave her credentials to a smart student.  Additionally, she gave her district issued laptop to said smart student, who used the internet to teach himself how to reveal our WPA2 password. (not difficult)  And just like that, 600 of our 800 students who have phones were on our wifi.  I have since remedied this and admit it occurred because I was not proactive enough.  Radius is used on this SSID.  No one in our district outside the IT department has administrative access on their computer.  The teacher was not reprimanded, nor was she even spoken to about it.  All of this ultimately was my fault, but I have learned and built back stronger.","Yes they should lose their job; the account credentials were SSO for the SIS system, she used her creds to join a students device to wifi, pretty sure that is against most districts IT policies.   Look at it from the perspective of any other industry; some places you get escorted out by 2 security guards right after HR/manager hands you your pink slip... No arguing, no union, directly to the unemployment line... Also depending on who you shared it with it can fall under corporate espionage/breach of contract and they will sue you.  The students willingly modified grades, attendance records, and disciplinary records in the SIS... Throw the book at them; that is computer fraud.  The teacher and the students are both at fault; teacher gave students her credentials therefore breaking IT/security policies, students went into SIS with teachers creds and changed data to fraudulent values.","I work with few schools, and I feel throughout my experience that teachers have this ""I'm a teacher not IT not my problem"". I had to talk to the person in charge of school to explain in this day of age of internet access with information the teacher can be part of the layered solutions. The issue will be on teacher problem as they rotate students, because the kids they are teaching are learning with internet access and they will think outside of the box.",Teachers are fired in my district for sharing passwords. It’s gotten crazy with the advent of zero trust.,What if the teacher DID give MFA ...,"I have argued that access to non-guest WiFi should be limited to school-managed devices only, which can only be enforced by using certificate-based authentication, since using passwords means anyone can connect their personal devices to the WiFi, and also when passwords change (or the account is locked) that could break the wifi authentication.",Then I can't help them. They shouldn't have access to a computer. Lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is confusing the parents and students. Can the Parent/Student Portal grades view be changed to reflect the actual grades as they appear in the teachers' PowerTeacher Pro grade book? Our hosting partner’s engineer says it can’t be done. Just wanted to get a second opinion.","If parents click on the grade for the the Q1 or whatever. They can see the grades.

I’m curious, what has everyone else sent out to explain what happened and what your steps are?","Get with lawyers.  Have them tell you what to say and how to say it.  Power school has issued a promise to disclose this to victims and our lawyers explained that kind of puts a legal limit on what you can do.  Seriously lawyer up for this.  It's crazy complicated and we as school systems and admins are stuck in a very awkward position in the middle here.  If you say the wrong thing, no matter how well intentioned, it could backfire on you and make things way worse than they already are.","Since it is considered public information anyway, here is what we sent   Late on January 7th, PowerSchool, the student information system used by our Districts and many others worldwide, notified us of a cybersecurity incident affecting their systems. PowerSchool has informed us that this incident involves unauthorized access to their data systems on a national scale. Since then, we have been diligently working to determine the impact on our districts. We have now confirmed that we are one of the many districts across the country affected by this breach.  We are deeply concerned about this situation and have been in continuous communication with PowerSchool to thoroughly understand the incident and to ensure that robust measures are in place to prevent any recurrence. PowerSchool has assured us that they have taken immediate steps to secure the data and will soon release a detailed communication that we will promptly share with our families, staff, and communities. PowerSchool has also informed its customers that it does not anticipate the data being shared or made public, and they believe it has been deleted without any further replication or dissemination.   Our top priority is the security of students’, staff, and families’ information. We are committed to maintaining transparency and will provide regular updates as we receive more information from PowerSchool. We understand the concern this may cause and appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate this challenging situation. Please know that we take the security of educational data very seriously and are taking all necessary steps to ensure the continued security of all systems.  Updates will be provided as soon as new information becomes available related to this incident.","We're one of the lucky districts that was not impacted (thanks to a Geo-block on our firewall preventing access by all non-US IP addresses).  We'll prepare some canned responses to parents/media once this story blows up in the news, but I don't think we're currently planning to send anything else out, unless we just get inundated with questions about whether our data was stolen.","We haven't sent out yet, but likely will shortly.  Was hoping to get a better understanding of the situation and some additional guidance and input from PS, legal, and other cyber security resources before moving forward.","Here's what my kid's school sent:  On the afternoon of Tuesday, January 7, 2025, our school district was informed by PowerSchool of a recent cybersecurity incident within the PowerSchool Student Information System (PowerSchool SIS). This incident has had a global impact on its customers, including our district. We are writing to share the information we have at this time, and outline the next steps in our response.     We recognize that incidents like this can cause significant concern, as protecting the privacy and security of personal information is a top priority. Please know that we are working with PowerSchool to better understand the scope of the cybersecurity incident and to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to safeguard the information. We will keep you informed of developments as they become available from PowerSchool.      Description of the Event  On December 28, 2024, PowerSchool discovered that a threat actor had accessed personal employee and student information from customers using the PowerSchool Student Information System (PowerSchool SIS). The threat actor exploited the user account of a PowerSchool technical support employee, allowing rapid access to and the downloading of millions of records from schools throughout the country between December 19 and December 24, 2024. This incident did not involve our school district’s network security or infrastructure.      More importantly, no passwords, social security numbers, or financial information was impacted by this incident. The type of information accessed varies by individual but may include student names, student ID numbers, parent/guardian contact information, dates of enrollment or withdrawal reasons, limited medical alert information (e.g., allergies or other conditions), and IEP/504 status.      Although PowerSchool has assured us that the risk of data dissemination or misuse is low, we remain vigilant and are leveraging all available resources to thoroughly assess the situation.      Next Steps in Response  Our Technology Department continues to review data and assess any additional actions that may be necessary. We are collaborating closely with other impacted school districts and leveraging our membership in both statewide and national educational technology organizations to ensure we have taken every possible step in responding to this cybersecurity incident.     PowerSchool has provided the next steps it is taking in response to this incident:    PowerSchool has engaged a third-party, cybersecurity firm, to investigate the incident.  PowerSchool has implemented additional information security best practices requiring updated credentials for all employees, and restricting access to their support system tools.      Additionally, in accordance with the Student Online Personal Protection Act (SOPPA), the school district has prepared additional contact information accessible through a separate document that has been created and posted on our website.     If you have any questions regarding this incident, please email [director], Director of Technology, at [email]","We sent out one, but powerschool is also suppose to provide use with a communication package","I received our notification on Jan 9 at 4:56pm MST with two template messages - one for staff and one for families.  Personally, I tend to like what other districts had already posted as ""official"" statements.  That said, do what your district's legal team says.","Our state released draft language in a memo. Copied, added my district info, added one additional line, and sent to our schools and social media channels Wednesday afternoon. Have gotten not the first question as of end of day Thursday.","So you confirmed in your firewall logs the connection attempts?  nice.  we have a couple geo blocks in place, but not a total ban on non-us.",Is it self hosted?,"We just sent out an email with a short overview of what happened, what information was accessed, that PS believes the data has been contained and deleted, and that we will notify everyone if more information becomes available.  On our website, since we are required to post breaches within 10 days, I went in to more detail about what data was accessed and how it was accessed.",Yeah. They said they would provide that by the end of the day yesterday. Has anyone actually received it?,"FW rules aren't logging failed/refused connections (because there are a LOT of them), so neither my firewall nor Splunk would tell me that it had refused the connection attempt.  It does log successful connections, however, and the IP doesn't appear in Splunk for that category.  We also had no instances of the tell-tale IP in our ps-audit-log, nor any of the tell-tale students_export.csv nor teachers_export.csv in our mass-data log.

However, what PowerSchool has shared and what school districts are seeing is concerning, to say the least. [https://k12techpro.com/what-we-know-about-the-powerschool-breach-so-far/](https://k12techpro.com/what-we-know-about-the-powerschool-breach-so-far/)",Maintenance account compromised.  Student and teacher data exfiltrated.  No evidence that it's on the dark web yet.  PS says it has assurance that it was deleted.  PS community helping each other figure out what was taken so measures can be taken to reach out to families.,"The most disappointing part is the lack of PowerSchool actually giving any specifics. We’ve had to use Reddit, listservs, and other sources to hear how to check the logs, verify what was downloaded, and cross reference what the fields actually mean.   A small group of Tech Directors figured out more in four hours than PowerSchool could in two weeks.",They've done multiple live webinars about this. If you weren't able to attend I suggest trying to find a recording.      Edit:     I sat in on one of the webinars. That article is not entirely correct. There's stuff in there that contradicts what PowerSchool themselves have said in the webinars. I expect this is a case of wanting to be first and not correct.,"I am new to a school that used Powerschool, but stopped before the 2024-2025 year. I am reading up on this situation, but so far have no clear steps that might need to be done? I have no access to Powerschool. I am thinking there may be historical data. Any advice, or are we trusting PS to handle it?","What I learned is that we need to keep our collective mouths closed and let the lawyers and insurance carriers lawyers hash it out.   I am an end user/protector of said data and the fact that we pay insane amounts to hire their services (with a contract) and that buys me some protections.     What it doesn't afford me is my 'opinion' or what they 'should do or shouldn't do'.     One of the main takeaways that I gathered from our lawyers is - Don't be so quick to voice your opinions on this yet.   Yes, they royally borked.  Yes, you pay good monies to ensure that they are bork resistant.  Yes they failed.    But make no mistake, their lawyer panel is deep as well.  And its not only for mitigation of situations like this.  They will also not hesitate to gaslight those rogues who want to poo poo on their practices and the results of this breach.",Maintenance account compromised *due to poor security practices.*,I’m just finding it impossible that they claim the data isn’t available online.  There’s no way a district could know that for certain.,But they have over 900 support staff!  (And like 4 subject matter experts.),They hosted multiple webinars where they explained what happened and did Q&As.,What is contradictory? Seems to have the same info that was shared on the webinar.,"if the server is still online and accessible, then someone should see if it was affected.  If not then I think you are good.",I’m still shocked that any one account had that much access for that long and that they didn’t have a SIEM in place that caught all that data leaving through one set of credentials.,I wonder if the account used the same password across all installs.,I’m sure they paid for the assurances by the attacker. Hard to trust the thief who just stole from you though. They keep saying it’s not ransomware but I feel like they’re using a very narrow definition if they’re paying the extortion.,The dark web monitoring tools are getting pretty good. We get info on leaks related to our accounts from our MDR and Kaduu.,"One account with no MFA, and through a publicly accessible portal.",[deleted],"From what they said in the webinar, it was actually a contractor support agent account that was compromised.  I'm sure no MFA as they avoided the question, but said MFA was taken care of by their VPN process now.",Yes and no.... It was an account that had access to maintenance utilities to connect into PowerSchool instances via the built in maintenance account.   From my understanding the maintenance accounts use a bearer token or a certificate credential based auth into PowerSchool systems that gets updated during upgrades/installs; it completely bypasses the standard login pages or OAUTH/Saml logins.,> They keep saying it’s not ransomware  Generally the term 'ransomware' is used to refer to hackers encrypting workstations and servers of their target and demanding money (a ransom) to decrypt them. This appears to have been outright data theft and extortion to ensure the stolen data was not released.,They said they paid the attacker and got video evidence that the info the was deleted. I'm still not completely confident that it won't show up eventually.  Hopefully more information will come out soon.,and the 'o' to 0   cos needs a number.,"In my previous school, PS support turned off ports on our locally hosted instance because of some DDoS worries - without telling us first and thus breaking some third-party functionality. It was annoying as heck.",I was in on the first webinar; fairly certain they said it is protected by MFA  & VPN now... Leading me to believe it was never protected by either 🤦‍♂️,"What is confusing/unclear is that the audit logs show the IP address from where the account is connecting from (for the incident, supposedly an IP located in Ukraine), which seems to indicate that this account allows direct remote connections without strong (mutual) authentication. Couple that with the fact that you can 'share' access of that account... is concerning.",And while that’s all true I think the non-technical public’s colloquial use of the term would include this situation even if it’s not the true definition.,Hopefully the attackers are incentivized to keep their word so that other companies will pay the ransom in the future. ,"this is how it works.  if the attackers never kept their word, no one would ever pay.",Correct.  You don't get the pay if you kill the hostages. (And no one will try to negotiate the next time if your track record says you just kill anyhow),"Yes and it only takes one attacker say ""f@ck it, I want more"" and sell the data anyways.  I wouldn't be surprised if the data is on some hard drive in a safe/safety deposit box in a bank somewhere for the attackers just waiting for everything to blow over in a couple years to cash it out.","maybe. there's no 100% way to know either way. but if attackers didn't keep their word in these situations no one would ever pay.   see the thing is, the data wasn't that valuable. it contains mostly the same information that you fill out when you create an account on a website somewhere. there's no financial information, there's no medical records, no social security numbers, no passwords, it's basically just names addresses and phone numbers.  there were a lot more sensitive information that could have been exported but the attackers only exported two tables out of the whole database on each system.   they can try to sell them in a few years but at best it would require a metric shit ton of social engineering for every single student record in order to try to gain from the data.   the data was simply way more valuable to PowerSchool and their reputation then it's actual value on the black market, imo.  my kids information is in this hack, and it doesn't worry me at all because I know exactly what they got, and it wasn't anything they haven't already given out.","Except for the boards/division/districts who where required to store SSN and Health care numbers...  Also I am fairly certain (90%) that the SSN field was exported from the students table.  So depending on the school authority, if the SSN was filled out, that data is valuable for decades.","yeah and the majority of schools don't have that information anymore. while there may be some out there. there isn't any reason for schools to have social security numbers. we were required to remove that years ago. that field isn't even in our student table anymore.   we don't know the details of the transaction between PowerSchool and the threat actors. there may be stipulations in there that say they get paid more later on if none of the data shows up. we will probably never know that.   it sucks that it happened, it could have been way worse for the schools , students, and teachers. but in my opinion, the target was PowerSchool and not it's customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Powerschool takes security seriously, though this incident undermines it.  THey are increasing investment in security.  #CISO Mishka McCowan **What happened**  - Support contractor credentials were compromised.  The name of the contractor is the one that appears in your logs. - Powersource is a forum and remote support tool - Powersource is used for remote support - Attacker accessed maintenance credentials. - The logs show clearly what was accessed and when. - First instance: Dec 19.   - Dec 19-21, increasing activity while the attacker explored and prepared. - Dec 22: The majority of exfiltration occurred - The attacker downloaded the Student table, the teacher table, then move on to the next target. - The speed and consistency of exfiltration indicates the attack was automated as of Dec 22. - Dec 23: Activity reduced, was likely manual at this point.  Most of it was done by then.    **Timeline and PS Response**  - Dec 28: Attacker notified them.  PS engaged Crowdstrike. - Identified the compromised account, which you see in your logs. - Disabled the compromised account. - Forced a reset of all PS credentials in that system - Removed maintenance access from all accounts except four, which are incident response. - Started to piece together what happened: What was downloaded (Student + Teacher).    - Found no evidence of backdoor user creation   - Found no evidence of other attack vectors via web   - Found no evidence of other local software vulnerabilities - Locked down Power Source   - Put the employee portion behind VPN   - Required password changes from employees   - Disabled maintenance access on Hosted instances    - On prem access remains at whatever you had it set to  - Moving forward PS will no longer have time-unlimited access.  They will need to request access each time.  Maintenance Access will not be turned by indefinitely.  It will turn off automatically in 1-30 days and need new action to turn it back on later. - Considering additional controls:   - Breaking maintenance into its own application away from PowerSource   - Looking into other ways to limit access from Maintenance to your SIS.   - As PS rolls out more controls, they promise to be transparent so your SIS availability is not impacted by surprise.  **Data impact**  - Student and Teacher tables.   - Student name, address, demo data, medical alerts, parent/guardian name, email, phone   - **Student Social Security Number field exists**.  Some districts don't collect this.   - On-prem districts will need to do some investigation to find out what exactly is in these, and whether SSN is included. - Crowdstrike report will be available late next week; perhaps slightly longer as they go through 15TB of logs.  # Q&A  - Name and contact of doctor, medical alert are included in their own field - MFA is enforced to log into the VPN where PowerSource is now accessed.  Eventually MFA will be required for PowerSource support staff, too. - Not sure if staff/students can be forced en masse to change passwords.  Check with your Customer Support Manager. - First indication of attack is Dec 19.  Dec 22 is where most of the attack activity took place. - There is no financial account information defined in the tables that were taken. - CyberSteward negotiated with the attacker who provided video evidence that they were deleting the data.  It shows the ""shred"" utility being used to delete the data.  Provided assurances there were no copies prior to the shred.   - How can we trust it?  It is their business.  Their reputation is part of that.  However, Crowdstrike is going to continue monitoring Dark Web traffic to detect if they break their word. - The student table should not contain password information.  It used to, but it had been moved to another location and should say something like ""MCAS MANAGED"" instead of containing password data. - On prem districts should turn off maintenance access.  They will contact you to turn it back on if needed. - PowerSchool says they will provide assistance with community communication. - Most districts do not have PII in the Student Table.  If your districts DOES have PII here, you will need to adjust your communication/notifications accordingly. - PowerSchool will provide some high level statements to get things started, by the end of day today.  Additionally they will provide communication plans as soon as possible (a few days) working with you specifically, especially on on-prem customers, to determine what communication is needed. - Credit monitoring for minors:  Depending on your state regulations, and the PII in your table.  We will work with you based on your impact to communicate directly and provide hotlines (??)  Stay tuned for more info on this. - When communicate, assure that the data is contained and will not be released.  We will provide credit monitoring where warranted. - PS is working to comply with each state's obligations and timelines.  They promise to assist districts to comply.  They are working to prepare a per-school analysis of the impact to support this notification. - Customers with medical data may need to work with PS on HIPAA disclosures - The compromised user may still appear to be connecting.  However, this is just a bug.  They have done a lot of testing to verify this is an mirage due to a bug.   - PS has a clear list of compromised schools, which was used to build notifications.  If you got a notification, you were affected.  Ask a CSM, providing your SIS URL, to check for sure.   - If you don't know who your CSM is, send a support ticket.  They'll reply promptly.  - Should we notify our Cybersecurity insurance?  PS is building an FAQ.  This is not yet available. - Will PS be communicating with parents?  They can provide it for Cloud easily.  For On-Prem they need cooperation.  If you want to communicate yourself, they'll provide a communication kit.   - A high level statement will be sent to you soon, which you can use to get started - Trends among targeted schools?  No.  The target was ""Powerschool SIS"", not any particular districts. - To turn off maintenance access, reach out to your CSM for the documentation or help. - There was no evidence that extensions or other data besides Student and Teacher tables was exfiltrated. - Confirm: Maintenance access was disabled.  On-prem customer need to do this themselves. - Photos were not exfiltrated. The only photo-related data was a field that indicates whether a photo exists - The total exfiltration is less than 1TB - Canadian and US instances were compromised in the same way - Some meaningless chatter about distinction about whether ""schools"" were attacked or PowerSource was attacked. . .  - Some more talk about how more answers are in FAQ, which will be updated. - Notifications were sent about other products.  It may have been too broad because of their haste.  Oops. - FAQ: Posted on Customer Community in the SIS section.  Log in and visit [this link](https://help.powerschool.com/t5/PowerSchool-SIS/ct-p/PowerSchoolSIS) - As soon as PS can complete analysis, they will provide you with notification about YOUR data, and the disclosures and communication that YOU are required to make.   - No plug-in data was compromised.  Student and Teacher table data only  # ""This event has concluded.

Their email said SIS only but I wonder if they confirmed or addressed that directly in other comms or the webinar.","Various conversations with a number of schools today. Many of them started by ""I got this email from Powerschool warning me about a breach. We've never been a Powerschool school."" Later, in the body of the email is a line that says something like: You are not a Powerschool customer so know that we have not lost any of your information.     Ignoring them advertising their failure to protect for a moment -- doesn't this indicate that they are maintaining an active list of every school district they can get information on and tracking them?  My kids used to call that ""skeevy"".","I'm a little confused.      So one of the things they did early was to disable the compromised account. How then were they able to do the investigation on those compromised systems? Are there other time-unlimited accounts built-in?  Was the compromised account baked into the application, with the same password for all customers?  Also:   ""The compromised user may still appear to be connecting. However, this is just a bug.

Anyone able to see it?,"Did anyone say how the support contractor's account was compromised?  Phishing? Brute Force?  Was there absolutely no MFA on the account?

PowerSchool has been and always will be a terrible company.,Thanks OP,"Theoretically if PS paid the attacker, then it's *reasonable* to assume that it's *possibly* contained. Often, ransomware attackers will hold their end of the bargain if paid.

It sounds like there is no MFA requirement for access to and through this system (speculation).,"SIS only.

We use School Messenger.,"If they have Schoology, that is why they got the email.

Full. Admin. Access. At all times.  The list was just pulled from their logs, that doesn't seem terribly difficult to believe. All of the actions by the threat actor were logged.","I didn’t hear how they were compromised, I just basically heard them say (on the second webinar) that the credentials found their way to the dark web and that’s where they were gotten ahold of.",Don't think they (IC) aren't discussing changing a lot of their practices right now.,"It's NOT a good business model to not keep your promises.  If your business is breached and your cyberinsurance company says ""oh you were breached by XXX, don't pay them they don't keep thier word"" or ""We won't pay XXX because they don't operate in good faith"" the threat actors won't get paid.  The Breachers know how to play the game and will typically ""follow the rules"" of it","Are they?  In my area, every district is hosted by PowerSchool except for one.","In the last 15 years or so, I have worked with maybe a dozen Powerschool districts.  Around 10 years ago, with a trend toward minimizing server hardware on site, all of my districts started moving to cloud-hosted.  It made sense because powerschool was the most hardware-hungry application on their servers.  When their servers came to End of Life, they took money out of their hardware + maintenance + backup budget, and put it into cloud hosting.  Some of them took the opportunity to remove server hardware completely.  The last on-prem instance I recall was probably 4 years ago.","I was trying to do the quick math too, but I suspect their entire SIS customer base was compromised (or very close to it).",In future I will be present and ask EMS to work through my screenshare.

Maybe there's a new marketing lead.","That probably IS it.   ""Relationships? You don't need relationships. Just sell our stuff!""","Which was my first thought. Turns out, that is what is/was happening in some cases, but not all.",So that maintenance account isn't the only one that has full admin access and there are others?  So that's the part that confuses me - how'd they (PowerSchool) log what the threat actor did against locally-hosted sites? Isn't it a direct connection between the threat IP and the target?,"I think we all have to assume that hackers aren't good, quality, honest people that keep their word.","> The Breachers know how to play the game and will typically ""follow the rules"" of it  Though, things aren't that simple.  These organizations are made of dozens of people.  There have been cases in the past of infighting where some of the individuals take the data and sell it even though they weren't supposed to.  Negotiators still pay ransoms hoping that it won't happen to this client this time. (Also, the negotiator gets paid.  If they stopped negotiating they'd be out of a job themselves.)  In the end, it's relying on ""honor among thieves"" and other perverse incentives.  There are no assurances.    PowerSchool knows this, but the horse is out of the barn.  No matter how hard they close the door, it's still out.  Now they are just trying to keep their jobs.",Maybe we just have more coordination and cooperation going on in Michigan. Many districts using PowerSchool are self hosted with a county-level consortium.,Same around here,"We were not compromised, but that's because we geo-lock our on-prem PowerSchool instance.  If you're not in the U.S., you can't get to it.","The account used is a global maintenance account. As I understand it, it's like default domain administrator in Microsoft speak. The account ID is listed as taking the actions, and it shows the connection IP of the account, which in this case was via a VPS provider hosted in Ukraine.  If it were me, I'd just filter the logs for that IP to track, and then run it again and filter for any actions taken by the maintenance account within a time frame, then run it again and filter for any specific commands sent across all time (like dumping entire user tables).  Then I'd have a pretty good picture of what happened.","in these cases, the data rarely ends up out in the open. Most of the data is already publicly available. It wasn't really that valuable except to PS's reputation.  Who cares about a few thousand names, addresses, and phone numbers? The hackers had ever reason to follow through with the delete so they get paid the next time they hack data again.  If every time a company paid off a hacker they still released the data, no one would pay anymore. This was a hack for financial gain.","in-team welching risks getting you blacklisted in ""the scene"" as well, criminals who renege can risk angrier retaliation than law enforcement  spinning up a new name means breaking off from old rep and cred, best option would be to spin the narrative so your welch is ""justified"" because of whatever drama  devil's advocate out of the way, yeah, cybersec has a high bar for being ""certain"" and you can't really say payoffs are certain","The data wasn't really that valuable. The target was PS's rep, not the schools.   However, PS's reputation is the thing that could be hurt the most here and is most valuable.  PS screwed up and paid for it to keep it contained.",Nearby district does the same thing and was compromised.  They had the maintenance account logging in with a US IP.  Everyone else I see was hit with the Ukrainian IP.,"That's my understanding of what the maintenance account is - my question is that if they prioritized shutting it down, how then did they get access to the affected sites to do investigation? Do they have *another* maintenance account?","Social security numbers along with all of the matching names, addresses, phone numbers, and medical data, is more valuable than you lead on. They have enough to assume full identities of these people.  Hackers aren't organizing in mass and deciding which set of morals they will adhere to for the greater good of the hacking community. Each hacker is motivated by maximizing their personal profit, or motivated by revenge or something like that. They don't care about other hackers and how much other hackers might not make in the future. You're thinking way too far into this. As much money as possible, right now. They want it on the front end from the insurance payout, and they want it on the back end when they either sell this data in mass, or use it to compromise identities for many years to come.  At most, these breaches give out credit monitoring/protection for a year. Fine, the hackers will sit on the data longer and then start compromising. Kids are especially valuable because they aren't keeping track of their credit.","Despite the downvotes, I think you're likely right.  Looking at it objectively, those two tables strike an emotional nerve, but aren't even the most valuable or damaging data held by PowerSchool.  They could have gone for employment, financial, medical, grading, and discipline records if they cared to sort through the data and pick out the juicy stuff for smaller sales and extortion scams.  But they went for the easy money instead.  They just needed to be able to say ""We have personal data on every family in your systems.  They're going to be really mad.  Pay us.""  PowerSchool is a $6 billion company.  The extortionist likely got a $10million+ windfall from this.  That's way easier than selling identities and credit card numbers one or two at a time.","No. They didn't shut down the maintenance account, just user access to it. Except for 4 people on the CISO's IR team.","This will be the next ""80 million + "" voters"" list in 4 years time.","I can speak for all schools, but we haven't stored SSNs for years and the only medical data was basic alert info and doctor info. No actual medical records were included. The student and teacher data tables don't contain ALL student and teacher data.  With the data that was accessed it would take a lot of extra work to social engineer your way to get anything worth value. Just best to export a buttload of data and extort the company with it and move on to your next ""project.""","The PII of potentially tens/hundreds of thousands of US children may not be that valuable *yet*, but....  That's all people who don't (yet) have a credit history. No bad credit. It's prime stolen identity - it just requires sitting on it for a while first.  And that's part of the danger that isn't being directly addressed here:  You can ""monitor the dark web"" and ""provide 2 years of identity theft protection"" but when you lose the name, address, phone number, school, DOB, relatives, SSN, and other PII for someone who potentially  doesn't turn 18 for 10+ years, the actions you're taking now don't really solve anything.    No one is opening a fraudulent credit card or taking out a loan under the identity of a 12 year old.  But if you can wait 6 years....  When little Johnny goes to open ask for his first loan at 20, he's told he doesn't qualify because of bad debt he's had since he was 18...  It's a bit like stealing new barrels full of freshly distilled whiskey - the real value comes in years later...","and that was my point, but reddit :)  you did a much better job writing it out though.","Which means ... the account (and access) still exists and is still useable?  It's a bit confusing to me too.  The nature of this sort of built-in account, to me, implies that there's no way to change it (aside from perhaps a code change in the product itself).  There's no password change/username, change/block access, right? Because it's baked in to every instance.  In theory, those instances could be not connected to the internet and the account would still exists, still authenticate, and still be useable (locally).  It's a back door in.  You can lock the door when you want, but you can't remove the door or change the locks.  Again, if I'm understanding it correctly - what they did now is try to put another door in front of that one.","They disallowed all powerschool employee users from self-escalating to have maintenance access, and supposedly are building in some controls where the maintenance access won't be persistent. I don't think that's near enough, but that's what they said.  Server instance maintenance should be completely separated from customer data, which should be siloed and no-knowledge to Powerschool staff. Any access to customer data should be expressly allowed via a manual action the customer takes within their Powerschool portal. LIke a support page with a toggle to 'allow Powerschool support access' and set a timer on it. I have a number of other tools I use with similar controls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

50,2025-01-07 13:49:23,So PowerSchool had a breach....,Chuckfromis,https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1hw1m3x/,"The email we received:     Dear Valued Customer,   As the Technical Contact for your district or school, we are reaching out to inform you that on December 28, 2024, PowerSchool become aware of a potential cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access to certain information through one of our community-focused customer support portals, PowerSource. Over the succeeding days, our investigation determined that an unauthorized party gained access to certain PowerSchool Student Information System (“SIS”) customer data using a compromised credential, and we regret to inform you that your data was accessed.     ","We were affected and got early access to a webinar today an hour and a half after notice went out. Essentially here's what we got...  1. We were affected if the email said we were. 2. The issue came from PowerSchool, not a school/district. 3. PowerSchool partnered with a company to ""ensure data was deleted"" while in contact with breachers. 4. Student and Teacher data tables breached and exported. 5. PowerSchool has taken action (that probably should have been implemented prior) to ensure this doesn't happen again. 6.

It states :  >We can confirm that the information accessed belongs to certain SIS customers and relates to families and educators, including those from your organization. The unauthorized access point was isolated to our PowerSource portal  So I'm thinking ""Ok, well PowerSource is different that PowerSchool, right? So perhaps this isn't that big of a deal.  It sounds like they are downplaying the impact.   But then...  >  As the PowerSource portal only permits access to the SIS database, we can confirm no other PowerSchool products were affected as a result of this incident.  Oh, ""Don't worry, the data accessed was *only* the  CORE DATABASE TO YOUR ENTIRE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM....  >     It spends 4-5 paragraphs explaining the general incident (while specifically saying that specifically *OUR* data was accessed.)

It even starts with ""Dear Valued Customer,"" and then says ""you are not a PowerSchool SIS customer"" later on.  My best guess is that they have my email because they are owned by Pearson and we use a few other Pearson products, but the email makes no mention of this or Pearson at all.

I might agree that perhaps Google has a lower risk than many other companies, as they have so many resources and provide advanced IT security services themselves, but it's not like there's no risk with Google Classroom being hacked. Perhaps less so from a technical/infrastructural point of view, but operationally (relying on weak passwords, use of shared devices, phishing attacks, etc.) there certainly are risks.  I'm no Luddite, but I do think we can reasonably question whether we're really doing so good in having so much of the education and learning taking place through online tools. That can of course be part of the curriculum, but I think there's reason for concern about data security (well, the article confirms that concern to be justified), while I'm not convinced at all that all that online work leads to better educational outcomes.

They have your childrens name and addresses for sale. Nothing can be done your shit is just out there.   People can use this info to deduce passwords etc and take your shit, people use kids names as their passwords the possibilities are endless.","For students between September 3, 1985 and August 31, 2017, the following information was compromised:  * First, Middle & Last Names * Date of Birth * Gender * Health Card Number * Ontario Education Number * Home Addresses * Home Phone Numbers * TDSB Student Number * TDSB Email Address * First Nations, Métis, Inuit Information  For students between September 1, 2017 and December 28, 2024, the following information was compromised:  * First, Middle & Last Names * Date of Birth * Gender * Health Card Number * Grade Level and School Information * Start/End Date as a Student * Ontario Education Number * EQAO Accommodation Information * Medical Information (ie. allergies, conditions, injuries) * Home Addresses * Home Phone Numbers * TDSB Student Number * TDSB Email Address * First Nations, Métis, Inuit Information * Residency Status * Principal/Vice Principal Notes (including discipline notes)",I'm among the old student batch. All my information would be out of date.,"Security is my 9-5, the TDSB and OCDSB are notorious for having lackluster information security/cyber security. They have suffered many breaches in the past, many undetected. My wife (teacher) receives blackmail emails now and then with odd threats. The address of ours they have on file is from 2019~2020*. My point being, our info is most definitely available for sale on the dark web, educate yourself and become security aware.","I’m not too concern, 90% of the compromised information isn’t relevant to me today. And I graduated from high school 10 years ago. Let the hackers see my terrible grades from high school lol","At the beginning of the year the tdsb sends out start of year forms online. If you click off you do not give your child permission to use electronic devises and teaching tools they school must respect your wishes.

Of course it would cause a hell of a headache for your child and the teacher because they would have to provide alternative learning...",Because we always need the cheapest possible option otherwise people flip their shit about government waste.

And your disciplinary record?   Suppose someone is interviewing for a job and they're doing well, they get to the third round of interviews and then unexpectedly get told they aren't suitable for the job. And it's because the prospective employer has pulled their disciplinary records from the stolen data and seen that they were a wild kid when they were a teenager and aren't the sort of person they want to hire.  Or travel insurance gets declined because they insurance company finds out a someone had a range of allergies when they were a kid and they don't want to risk an expensive bill when someone needs to be flown back from Thailand.","Download Tor it's easy as pie, make sure you have some Bitcoin if you want to purchase the data.","If a potential employer uses stolen, private data to evaluate a job candidate, I don't want to work there!","You have valid points I haven’t thought of.

54,2025-02-21 15:12:48,WCPSS emergency notification question,wishadoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/1iv3ajb/,"Sorry this is long. It has been a frustrating situation from the jump and I'm hoping someone here may be able to offer more insight or suggestions since it's anonymous. lol   I'm the grandparent of a kindergartener. At the school orientation day when the forms were filled out, his mom (my daughter) and her partner put their info on the form as parents. I am listed as an emergency contact. We didn't know at the time that those two names and contact info are the only ones who get emergency notifications from the school. This is a huge problem because his mom travels a lot, often to different time zones, and I watch him. I'm also the person who takes him and picks him up. That's why I followed this subreddit to get snow closing info because I couldn't on her to forward info in a timely manner! lol   When we first discovered this I called the principal to explain the situation and was gently told it's up to the parents to add me. Which is fair. But my daughter can't see how to add me; she can't see how to even add an additional number under her profile at PowerSchool and just use my number. (In the olden days there were options for home, work and cell). School Messenger didn't work either. Her partner is not in the picture at this moment.   I know if there is an individual emergency that I'll eventually be called, but if there is news of early dismissal or something that is school or district-wide, I can't rely on the teachers to use ClassDojo. I need to have access to the district notification system. I was on it years ago when my daughter was a student and it continued long after she graduated, and now I regret ever getting off of the list.   I'm panicking a wee bit because my daughter is going out of the country this week and I don't want to have to stay glued to this subreddit in case something school-related happens that I need to know about. lol   Daughter has very little time and patience right now, so it would help if I could give her specific instructions as to how to get me added. Any suggestions? TIA! ",This seems like something the school's data manager should be able to help with but your daughter would probably need to go to the school in person or at least call. ,Also consider setting up alerts from the wcpss Facebook page- they post district-wide closures there.,"Unfortunately, there’s this.  https://preview.redd.it/7hbgec3mhkke1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=925e4f868449bd70581e849a50260f9306652518  There ought to be a way to add additional numbers, but looks like it’s not possible. Could your daughter set up her phone or email to automatically forward calls/emails to you?","Your daughter absolutely should go in person and talk to the data manager. This can be done, but they won't do it remotely,  as they have to verify.","Yeah, we started with the data manager and she deferred to the principal who told daughter (I neglected to add this to the OP) that without me being an official guardian I can’t be added. (Partner isn’t either but that initial form didn’t ask about legalities.) She then called the district and was told the same thing.",That’s a great idea! Thx,"Yeah, you’d think there would be another option. Families are complex. Oh well, thank you for trying. The FB tip is excellent. 🙂","School messenger? Because text/districtemail/school email/teacher email/powerschool/dojo/talkingpoints/canvas/phone calls aren’t enough?   Unrelated to OP’s plight, but man I wish this school district would decide HOW they wish to communicate.","I left out important stuff in the OP. Sorry. We gave up in September but it’s an issue again.   The data mgr at the school deferred to the principal who told my daughter I can’t be added bc I’m not a legal guardian. The district said the same thing, but I forget who the district contact was.","Twitter used to be the first to have closure notifications- even before staff found out! But it seems they don’t post them there now, so FB it is! I’d also contact the teacher who’d probably be happy to add your email to any groups he/she has for classroom info.","School messenger is the manager for sending all of those messages when they need to come from the district or school, and not just teachers.","That really sucks. I would ask one more time and make a big show of writing down names, dates, quotes. And I would pursue some type of limited guardianship in the meantime, if you see this as an ongoing situation. I'm really sorry they are being so inflexible.","You’re right. I have medical POA in case of her absence since he was born and the preschool was super flexible. But I really need something more definitive since I have him so often. It’s an unwelcome process that younger parents tend to put off, but I need to encourage her to get several legal documents drawn up.","Yes, I agree. It's hard to do, but very necessary! You might want to ask for advice in one of legal subs... I had an exchange student several years ago, and had a limited guardianship. It was a very quick process, and basically allowed the school to talk to me about her. She was enrolled at the school where I taught, lol",Oh wow! Great idea. Thank you!,YW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything you said is spot on but you saved the best for last..  Public data should be 100% purged in situations like this. If it needs to stay around it should be glacier or off line storage with highly restricted audited access.

This could turn into the largest cybersecurity incident in the K-12 Space. I’m surprised more people aren’t talking about this. ,"> After investigating the incident, it was determined that the threat actor gained access to the portal using compromised credentials and stole data using an ""export data manager"" customer support tool.  > ""The unauthorized party was able to use a compromised credential  to access one of our community-focused customer support portals called PowerSource,"" PowerSchool told BleepingComputer in a statement.  > ""PowerSource contains a maintenance access tool that allows PowerSchool  engineers to access Customer SIS instances for ongoing support and to troubleshoot performance issues.""  It's like the okta breach on steroids.","My kids' school set up an email notifying us of the breach. In the email it stated  >PowerSchool identified that unauthorized access occurred between December 19 and December 23, 2024. The incident involved limited student and staff data. PowerSchool has assured us that the breach has been contained, and the accessed data has been deleted without being shared publicly.","I’d love to see this topic in the WAN show.  I work in a school system as a technician. PowerSchool has been awful about communicating anything to systems. Most of the information about what has happened has been collaboration between school systems.  It’s still shocking to me that PowerSchool has not been enforcing two factor on anyone even its employees. This is tens of thousands of students and staff personal information leaked, and PowerSchool let it happen.  The best part is PowerSchool says they got a video that shows the deletion of the data. So therefore everything is good, and we shouldn’t need to worry!
