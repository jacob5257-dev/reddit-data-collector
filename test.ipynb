       "['Host Rich Stroffolino will be chatting with our guest,\\xa0**Dan Holden, CISO, BigCommerce**\\xa0about some of the biggest stories in cybersecurity this past week. You are invited to watch and participate in the live discussion.   We go to air at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET. Just go to YouTube Live here\\xa0[https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY](https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY)\\xa0or you can\\xa0[subscribe to the Cyber Security Headlines podcast](https://cisoseries.com/subscribe-podcast/)\\xa0and get it into your feed.  Here are the stories we plan to cover:  **Ransomware attacks on food and agriculture industry have increased this year**   Speaking at RSA, Jonathan Braley, director of the Food and Agriculture-Information Sharing and Analysis Center, (Food and Ag-ISAC), said that paired with the increase in ransomware attacks is the fact that many go unreported, preventing visibility into the full scope of the problem. The increase in attacks seems to stem from activities by the Clop ransomware gang, specifically its exploitation of MOVEit, GoAnywhere and Accellion, as well as activity from the groups RansomHub and Akira. The industry saw 84 attacks from January to March, more than double the number seen in Q1 2024. A report from Food and Ag-ISAC says that industries in food, agriculture, and manufacturing typically face ransomware attacks because they tend to have more legacy equipment and industrial control systems, making them easier targets.   ([The Record](https://therecord.media/ransomware-attacks-food-and-ag-double-2025))  **Congress challenges Noem over proposed CISA cuts**   On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem faced tough questioning from members of Congress about the Trump administration’s proposal to cut CISA’s funding by $491 million, as part of their “skinny budget.” Homeland Security subcommittee chair Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., said at a time when government leaders are saying China is getting the better of the U.S. in cyberspace, appropriators need more information on the budget proposal. Top panel Democrat, Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), said to Noem, “Last week you said we should ‘just wait’ for the president’s grand cyber plan. But you have not waited to erode the department’s cyber defense capabilities by removing resources and personnel from CISA and other components.” Noem maintained that instead of “censorship,” CISA is now focused on securing critical infrastructure. She added that the president’s cyber plan would be “coming out shortly and that’s the president’s prerogative.”   ([CyberScoop](https://cyberscoop.com/house-questions-trump-cisa-budget-cuts-2025/)\\xa0and[\\xa0The Record](https://therecord.media/noem-house-hearing-proposed-cisa-funding-cuts))  **Disney Slack attacker turns out to be Ryan from California**   Following up on a story we covered last July, in which The Walt Disney Company suffered the theft of more than one terabyte of data through its Slack channels, it turns out that the perpetrator was not a Russian hacktivist group, but was instead, 25-year-old California resident Ryan Mitchell Kramer. The hack was originally described as retribution against Disney for how it handled artist contracts, their use of AI, and how it treated its consumers. Now, according to the Department of Justice, “Kramer published a program online that purported to be an AI art generation app but actually contained malware that gave him remote access to the victim’s computer. A Disney employee downloaded the program, allowing Kramer to nab login credentials for various accounts in their name, including their Disney Slack account.” Kramer has agreed to plead guilty to one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information, and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, which could lead to ten years in prison.   ([The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/02/disney_slack_hacker_revealed_to/))  **NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167 million in damages**   On Tuesday, after a five-year legal battle, a jury ruled that NSO Group must pay the Meta-owned platform $167,256,000 in punitive damages and around $444,719 in compensatory damages. WhatsApp accused NSO Group of exploiting an audio-calling vulnerability in the chat app to target around 1,400 people, including dissidents, human rights activists, and journalists. WhatsApp was seeking more than $400,000 in compensatory damages, based on the time its employees spent on investigating and remediating the attacks. A WhatsApp’s spokesperson hailed the historic ruling as, “the first victory against illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone.” NSO Group said it plans to carefully review the details of the verdict and left the door open for an appeal.   ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/nso-group-must-pay-more-than-167-million-in-damages-to-whatsapp-for-spyware-campaign/))  **Telemessage stores plaintext chat logs, suspends services**   TeleMessage, a federal contractor that sold a modified version of Signal called TM SGNL to senior US officials, can reportedly access plaintext chat logs—despite marketing claims suggesting end-to-end encryption. Security researcher Micha Lee analyzed the app’s Android source code and found it insecure, confirming TeleMessage’s access. The company was recently hacked twice, leaking sensitive data and prompting it to suspend operations. Senator Ron Wyden has now called for a DOJ investigation, citing the app as a potential national security threat due to its insecure design and foreign ties.   ([Micha Lee](https://micahflee.com/despite-misleading-marketing-israeli-company-telemessage-used-by-trump-officials-can-access-plaintext-chat-logs/))  **LockBit ransomware gang hacked**   As quoted in BleepingComputer, “the LockBit ransomware gang has suffered a data breach after its dark web affiliate panels were defaced and replaced with a message linking to a MySQL database dump,” which itself appears to have occurred on April 29. It is not known who carried out this breach or how they did it, but the defacement message, which reads, “Don\\'t do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague,\" matches one used in a recent breach of the dark web site belonging to Everest ransomware, suggesting a possible link. BleepingComputer continues “It\\'s too early to tell if this additional reputation hit will be the final nail in the coffin for the ransomware gang.”   ([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-gang-hacked-victim-negotiations-exposed/))  **PowerSchool hacker now extorting individual school districts**   Following up on a story we have been covering since January, the education technology company PowerSchool now says that despite having paid a ransom, “the same threat actor is now attempting to use the stolen data to extort the individual school districts that it works with.” The breach, which occurred in December, exposed sensitive personal data of more than 60 million K-12 students and more than nine million teachers. PowerSchool had expressed confidence that the incident had been resolved, telling Bleeping Computer the hacker shared a video which purported to show the data being deleted. Apparently, this was not the end of the story as at least four school boards have contacted with extortion requests.

These were some of the bigger ones that got some notoriety, so roughly 1 per year since 2019:  Raptor Technologies: In January 2024, Raptor Technologies, a school safety software company, experienced a significant data breach. This breach exposed millions of records, including sensitive data and personal information of students, parents, and staff. The breach involved the exposure of over 4 million records. The data included school lockdown plans, student medical records, information on students flagged as posing a threat, evacuation plans, court documents, staff and student ID numbers, and details about school security measures.

CPS used a teacher evaluation vendor named Battelle for Kids, which was the target of a ransomware attack. As a result, nearly 500,000 CPS students and close to 60,000 employees had their personal data exposed.

The breach affected about 13,000 school and university accounts.\\xa0\",\n",
       " \"Smallish to med size school district here in California. We are required per our technology insurance companies to have security tools and protocols in place to prevent any ransomware attack. Some of the smaller schools districts struggle with those costs due to the price to implement these security requirements. There needs to be more money provided to the smaller school districts to protect them from these attacks. But even large districts like this Canadian one can be breached. Even the LA school district got attacked. They never paid a ransom but it took them down for a bit. Powerschool is its own SIS cloud based entity. So either one of the schools accounts that accesses powerschool was compromised or something, the article doesn't get into details on how they where breached.\",\n",

       " \"Most that data isn't that sensitive.  Kind of depends what we are talking about with medical data.    I think at some point we lost the plot on data classification.

       " 'Not deleting data? No longer getting payments. Like with everything, your insatiable greed is your end.',\n",
       " \"Some people are saying we already lose cyber war due to ransomware etc.. People lose to cyber war because some goverments allowing ransomware and they actually support it.

       " \"This makes me so angry to think about, but it's just another item on the list of things underfunded in public education in the US. The vast majority of districts need help. Some in my state have banded their IT resources together so they can get volume discounts. It's better, but it's not enough. The free resources provided by MS-ISAC are a boon, but they need more state funding if they are going to stand a modicum of a chance against cybercrime actors with cash to burn.\",\n",
       " \">even after the company paid hackers to delete the stolen data. Turns out the data wasn't wiped after all.  This kind a behavior damages the reputation of ALL ransomware groups, and will likely lead to the group that perpetrated this attack to be attacked or turned in by other groups, funnily enough.  Ransomware groups have a pretty strong code that is there to benefit all of them.

When looking at serious successfull cyber attacks a point I'd like to see more emphasis on is that the defenders will be in utter chaos. People break in such conditions from having decades of work invalidated, from extreme workload, and from extreme pressure from everywhere else. A good rule of thumb is that from the team originally responsible for the attacked service half will be unfit for work overnight. Especially the team lead and often permanently. This is the type of stress that can literally kill people.   In that situation you will have among others to onboard internal replacements for the lost colleagues, external specialists, likely a new team structure, and often completely throw any and all established procedures (as assumed unsafe) overboard, completely relearning how to do your job.   The thing that breaks first here is internal communications. People doing their utmost to save what's left on a technical side have neither the time nor mental capacity to sit down and write cohesive reports. They don't have an established leadership structure ensuring that to happen. And even if they have, these situations are so fluidly moving in parallel that it's impossible to stay up to date. You'll produce more meeting notes per hour than can be read in the same.   As such those in the company not directly involved - especially the higher ups which do get a lot of related work and stresses -\\xa0 will not have a good idea of what's going on.\\xa0   TlDr: very long winded way of saying that sparse public comment is majorly caused by companies themselves not knowing what's happening and given a large enough issue cannot reasonably be expected to know either.
